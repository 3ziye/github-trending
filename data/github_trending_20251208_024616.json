Write smooth UI animations with minimal code.\n\n```cpp\n// Animate anything in one line\nfloat alpha = iam_tween_float(id, channel, hovered ? 1.0f : 0.5f, 0.3f, ease, policy, dt);\n```\n\n## Why ImAnim?\n\n- **Immediate-mode friendly** - Works naturally with ImGui's paradigm\n- **Zero dependencies** - Only requires Dear ImGui\n- **Large easing collection** - 30+ easing functions including spring physics\n- **Perceptual color blending** - OKLAB and OKLCH\n- **Responsive layouts** - Anchor-relative animations that survive window resizing\n\n## Features at a Glance\n\n| Category | Capabilities |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Tweens** | Float, Vec2, Vec4, Int, Color with crossfade/cut/queue policies |\n| **Clips** | Timeline keyframes, looping, callbacks, chaining, stagger |\n| **Easing** | Quad to Bounce presets, cubic-bezier, steps, spring physics |\n| **Paths** | Bezier curves, Catmull-Rom splines, text along paths |\n| **Procedural** | Oscillators, shake, wiggle, Perlin/Simplex noise |\n| **Extras** | Style interpolation, scroll animation, debug inspector |\n\n## Quick Integration\n\n**Step 1:** Copy `im_anim.h` and `im_anim.cpp` to your project.\n\n**Step 2:** Add two lines after `ImGui::NewFrame()`:\n\n```cpp\nImGui::NewFrame();\n\n// Add these two lines\niam_update_begin_frame();\niam_clip_update(ImGui::GetIO().DeltaTime);\n\n// Your UI code...\n```\n\n**Step 3:** Animate! Here's a hover effect:\n\n```cpp\nbool hovered = ImGui::IsItemHovered();\nfloat scale = iam_tween_float(\n    ImGui::GetID(\"btn\"), ImHashStr(\"scale\"),\n    hovered ? 1.1f : 1.0f, 0.2f,\n    iam_ease_preset(iam_ease_out_back),\n    iam_policy_crossfade,\n    ImGui::GetIO().DeltaTime\n);\n```\n\nThat's it.

      "readme": "# Ban-Rays\n**Glasses to detect smart-glasses that have cameras**\n\nI'm experimenting with 2 main approaches:\n* [Optics](#optics): classify the camera using light reflections.\n* [Networking](#networking): bluetooth and wi-fi analysis.\n\nSo far fingerprinting specific devices based on bluetooth (BLE) is looking like easiest and most reliable approach. The picture below is the first version, which plays the legend of zelda 'secret found' jingle when it detects a BLE advertisement from Meta Raybans.\n\n![](banrays_physical_v1.png)\n\nI'm essentially treating this README like a logbook, so it will have my current approaches/ideas.\n\n## Optics\n\nBy sending IR at camera lenses, we can take advantage of the fact that the CMOS sensor in a camera reflects light directly back at the source (called 'retro-reflectivity' / 'cat-eye effect') to identify cameras.\n\n![](irrb.jpg)\n\nThis isn't exactly a new idea. Some researchers in 2005 used this property to create 'capture-resistant environments' when smartphones with cameras were gaining popularity. \n* https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/papers/cre.pdf\n\nThere's even some recent research (2024) that figured out how to classify individual cameras based on their retro-reflections.\n* https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-32-8-13836\n\nNow we have a similar situation to those 2005 researchers on our hands, where smart glasses with hidden cameras seem to be getting more popular. So I want to create a pair of glasses to identify these. Unfortunately, from what I can tell most of the existing research in this space records data with a camera and then uses ML, a ton of controlled angles, etc. to differentiate between normal reflective surfaces and cameras. \n\nI would feel pretty silly if my solution uses its own camera. So I'll be avoiding that. Instead I think it's likely I'll have to rely on being consistent with my 'sweeps', and creating a good classifier based on signal data. For example you can see here that the back camera on my smartphone seems to produce quick and large spikes, while the glossy screen creates a more prolonged wave. \n\n![](ts_plot_labeled.png)\n\n![](ts_plot_spikes.png)\n\nAfter getting to test some Meta Raybans, I found that this setup is not going to be sufficient. Here's a test of some sweeps of the camera-area + the same area when the lens is covered. You can see the waveform is similar to what I saw in the earlier test (short spike for camera, wider otherwise), but it's wildly inconsistent and the strength of the signal is very weak. This was from about 4 inches away from the LEDs. I didn't notice much difference when swapping between 940nm and 850nm LEDs.\n\n![](ir_rayban_first_sweeps.png)\n\nSo at least with current hardware that's easy for me to access, this probably isn't enough to differentiate accurately.\n\nAnother idea I had is to create a designated sweep 'pattern'. The user (wearing the detector glasses) would perform a specific scan pattern of the target. Using the waveforms captured from this data, maybe we can more accurately fingerprint the raybans. For example, sweeping across the targets glasses in a 'left, right, up, down' approach. I tested this by comparing the results of the Meta raybans vs some aviators I had lying around. I think the idea behind this approach is sound (actually it's light), but it might need more workshopping.\n\n![](ir_rayban_sweeping_pattern.png)\n\n### IR Circuit\n\nFor prototyping, I'm using:\n* Arduino uno\n* a bunch of 940nm and 850nm IR LEDs\n* a photodiode as a receiver\n* a 2222A transistor\n\n![](basicsetup.jpg)\n\nTODO:\n* experiment with sweeping patterns\n* experiment with combining data from different wavelengths\n* collimation?\n\n## Networking\n\nThis has been more tricky than I first thought! My current approach here is to fingerprint the Meta Raybans over Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) advertisements. But, **I have only been able to detect BLE traffic during 1) pairing 2) powering-on**. I sometimes also see the advertisement as they are taken out of the case (while already powered on), but not consistently. \n\n![](ble_detect.jpg)\n\nThe goal is to detect them during usage when they're communicating with the paired phone, but to see this type of directed BLE traffic it seems like I would first need to see the `CONNECT_REQ` packet which has information as to what which of the communication channels to hop between in sync. I don't think what I currently have (ESP32) is set up to do this kind of following.\n* potentially can use an [nRF module](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Sniffer-for-Bluetooth-LE) for this\n\nFor any of the bluetooth classic (BTC) traffic, unfortunately the hardware seems a bit more involved (read: expensive). So if I want to do down this route, I'll likely need a more clever solution here.\n\nWhen turned on or put into pairing mode (or sometimes when taken out of the case), I can detect the device through advertised manufacturer data and service UUIDs. `0x01AB` is a Meta-specific SIG-assigned ID ",
