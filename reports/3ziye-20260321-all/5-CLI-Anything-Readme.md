## 📰 News

> Thanks to all invaluable efforts from the community! More updates continuously on the way everyday..

- **2026-03-17** 🌐 Launched the **[CLI-Hub](https://hkuds.github.io/CLI-Anything/hub/)** — a central registry where you can browse, search, and install any CLI with a single `pip` command. Contributors can add new CLIs or update existing ones by simply opening a PR with a `registry.json` entry. The hub updates automatically on merge.

- **2026-03-16** 🤖 Added **SKILL.md generation** (Phase 6.5) — every generated CLI now ships with an AI-discoverable skill definition inside the Python package. ReplSkin auto-detects the skill file after `pip install`, and the REPL banner displays the absolute path for agents. Includes `skill_generator.py`, Jinja2 template, `package_data` in all setup.py files, and 51 new tests.

- **2026-03-15** 🐾 Support for **OpenClaw** from the community! Merged Windows `cygpath` guard to ensure CLI-Anything works reliably in Windows bash environments. Community contributions continue to strengthen cross-platform support.

- **2026-03-14** 🔒 Fixed a GIMP Script-Fu path injection vulnerability and added **Japanese README** translation. OpenCode version requirements documented alongside several Windows compatibility improvements.

<summary>Earlier news</summary>

- **2026-03-13** 🔌 **Qodercli** plugin officially merged as a community contribution with dedicated setup scripts. Codex skill gained a Windows install script, and placeholder URLs were cleaned up across the project.

- **2026-03-12** 📦 **Codex skill** integration landed, bringing CLI-Anything to yet another AI coding platform. Qodercli support was also introduced, and documentation was updated with limitations and experimental labels.

- **2026-03-11** 📞 **Zoom** video conferencing harness added as the 11th supported application. Multiple community fixes shipped for Shotcut auto-save, LibreOffice Windows/macOS backend, and OpenCode support.

## 🤔 Why CLI?

CLI is the universal interface for both humans and AI agents:

• **Structured & Composable** - Text commands match LLM format and chain for complex workflows

• **Lightweight & Universal** - Minimal overhead, works across all systems without dependencies

• **Self-Describing** - --help flags provide automatic documentation agents can discover

• **Proven Success** - Claude Code runs thousands of real workflows through CLI daily

• **Agent-First Design** - Structured JSON
