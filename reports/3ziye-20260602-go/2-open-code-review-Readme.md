## What is Open Code Review?

Open Code Review is an AI-powered code review CLI tool. It originated as Alibaba Group's internal official AI code review assistant — over the past two years, it has served tens of thousands of developers and identified millions of code defects. After thorough validation at massive scale, we incubated it into an open source project for the community. Simply configure a model endpoint to get started.

It reads Git diffs, sends changed files to a configurable LLM via an agent with tool-use capabilities, and generates structured review comments with line-level precision. The agent can read full file contents, search the codebase, inspect other changed files for context, and produce deep reviews — not just surface-level diff feedback.

## Why Open Code Review?

### The Problem with General-Purpose Agents

If you've used general-purpose agents like Claude Code with Skills for code review, you've likely encountered these pain points:

- **Incomplete coverage** — On larger changesets, agents tend to "cut corners," selectively reviewing only some files and missing others.
- **Position drift** — Reported issues frequently don't match the actual code location, with line numbers or file references drifting off target.
- **Unstable quality** — Natural-language-driven Skills are hard to debug, and review quality fluctuates significantly with minor prompt variations.

The root cause: a purely language-driven architecture lacks hard constraints on the review process.

### Core Design: Deterministic Engineering × Agent Hybrid

Open Code Review's core philosophy is to combine deterministic engineering with an agent, each handling what it does best.

**Deterministic Engineering — Hard Constraints**

For review steps that *must not go wrong*, engineering logic — not the language model — guarantees correctness:

- **Precise file selection** — Determines exactly which files need review and which should be filtered, ensuring no important change is missed.
- **Smart file bundling** — Groups related files into a single review unit (e.g., `message_en.properties` and `message_zh.properties` are bundled together). Each bundle runs as a sub-agent with isolated context — a divide-and-conquer strategy that stays stable on very large changesets and naturally supports concurrent review.
- **Fine-grained rule matching** — Matches review rules to each file's characteristics, keeping the model's attention sharply focused and eliminating information noise at the source. Compared to purely language-driven rule guidance, template-engine-based rule matching is more stable and predictable.
- **External positioning and reflection modules** — Independent comment-positioning and comment-reflection modules systematically improve both the location accuracy and content accuracy of AI feedback.

**Agent — Dynamic Decision-Making**

The agent's strengths are concentrated where they matter most — dynamic decisions and dynamic context retrieval:

- **Scenario-tuned prompts** — Prompt templates deeply optimized for code review, improving effectiveness while reducing token consumption.
- **Scenario-tuned toolset** — Distilled from deep analysis of tool-call traces in large-scale production data — including call frequency distributions, per-tool repetition rates, and the impact of new tools on the overall call chain — resulting in a purpose-built toolset that is more stable and predictable for code review than a generic agent toolkit.

## How to Use
