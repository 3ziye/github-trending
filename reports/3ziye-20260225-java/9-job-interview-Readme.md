## Data Structures
### Linked List
 * A *Linked List* is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each
   pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure
   consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 * **Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
 * **Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
 * **Circular-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Stack
 * A *Stack* is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: *push*, which adds to the collection, and
   *pop*, which removes the most recently added element
 * **Last in, first out data structure (LIFO)**: the most recently added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Queue
 * A *Queue* is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: *enqueue*, which inserts an element
   into the queue, and *dequeue*, which removes an element from the queue
 * **First in, first out data structure (FIFO)**: the oldest added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Tree
 * A *Tree* is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph

### Binary Tree
 * A *Binary Tree* is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
   the *left child* and *right child*
 * **Full Tree**: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
 * **Perfect Binary Tree**: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
 * **Complete Tree**: a binary tree in which every level *except possibly the last* is full and all nodes in the last
   level are as far left as possible

### Binary Search Tree
 * A binary search tree, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each
   node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored
   in the right sub-tree
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(log(n))`
   * Search: `O(log(n))`
   * Insert: `O(log(n))`
   * Remove: `O(log(n))`

### Trie
* A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative
  array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated
