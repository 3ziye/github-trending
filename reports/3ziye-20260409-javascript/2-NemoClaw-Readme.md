<!-- start-intro -->
NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source reference stack that simplifies running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) always-on assistants more safely.
It installs the [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) runtime, part of NVIDIA Agent Toolkit, which provides additional security for running autonomous agents.

> **Alpha software**
>
> NemoClaw is available in early preview starting March 16, 2026.
> This software is not production-ready.
> Interfaces, APIs, and behavior may change without notice as we iterate on the design.
> The project is shared to gather feedback and enable early experimentation.
> We welcome issues and discussion from the community while the project evolves.

NemoClaw adds guided onboarding, a hardened blueprint, state management, OpenShell-managed channel messaging, routed inference, and layered protection on top of the [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) runtime. For the full feature list, refer to [Overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/about/overview.html). For the system diagram, component model, and blueprint lifecycle, refer to [How It Works](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/about/how-it-works.html) and [Architecture](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemoclaw/latest/reference/architecture.html).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to install NemoClaw and run your first sandboxed OpenClaw agent.

<!-- start-quickstart-guide -->

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, check the prerequisites to ensure you have the necessary software and hardware to run NemoClaw.

#### Hardware

| Resource | Minimum        | Recommended      |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU      | 4 vCPU         | 4+ vCPU          |
| RAM      | 8 GB           | 16 GB            |
| Disk     | 20 GB free     | 40 GB free       |

The sandbox image is approximately 2.4 GB compressed. During image push, the Docker daemon, k3s, and the OpenShell gateway run alongside the export pipeline, which buffers decompressed layers in memory. On machines with less than 8 GB of RAM, this combined usage can trigger the OOM killer. If you cannot add memory, configuring at least 8 GB of swap can work around the issue at the cost of slower performance.

#### Software

| Dependency | Version                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Node.js    | 22.16 or later |
| npm        | 10 or later |
| Platform   | See below |

#### OpenShell Lifecycle

For NemoClaw-managed environments, use `nemoclaw onboard` when you need to create or recreate the OpenShell gateway or sandbox.
Avoid `openshell self-update`, `npm update -g openshell`, `openshell gateway start --recreate`, or `openshell sandbox create` directly unless you intend to manage OpenShell separately and then rerun `nemoclaw onboard`.

#### Container Runtimes

The following table lists tested platform and runtime combinations.
Availability is not limited to these entries, but untested configurations may have issues.

<!-- platform-matrix:begin -->
| OS | Container runtime | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------------|--------|-------|
| Linux | Docker | Tested | Primary tested path. |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Colima, Docker Desktop | Tested with limitations | Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) and start the runtime before running the installer. |
| DGX Spark | Docker | Tested | Use the standard installer and `nemoclaw onboard`. |
| Windows WSL2 | Docker Desktop (WSL backend) | Tested with limitations | Requires WSL2 with Docker Desktop backend. |

### Install NemoClaw and Onboard OpenClaw Agent

Download and run the installer script.
The script installs Node.js if it is not already present, then runs the guided onboard wizard to create a sandbox, configure inference, and apply security policies.

> **ℹ️ Note**
>
> NemoClaw creates a fresh OpenClaw instance inside the sandbox during the onboarding process.
>
> The installer runs as your normal user and does not require `sudo` or root.
> It installs Node.js via nvm and NemoClaw via npm, both into user-local directories.
> Docker must be installed and running before you run the installer. I
