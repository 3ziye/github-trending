![disktree: a home directory as a treemap, coloured by kind of data, with reclaimable space hatched and the selection, findings and free space in the side panel](assets/screenshot.png)

Find what is filling a disk, mark what should go, and remove it — with the
volume's free space in view the whole time.

disktree is a treemap for Omarchy. It scans your home directory by default,
draws every directory as a nested mosaic sized by what it really costs on disk,
and lets you walk into it with the keyboard or the mouse. Mark as much as you
like; nothing happens until you review the list and commit, and the permanent
path always asks first.

Built with [GPUI](https://gpui-kit.com/) through
[gpui-omarchy](https://github.com/huacnlee/gpui-omarchy), so it follows your
Omarchy theme and behaves like the rest of the desktop.

## Install

Download `disktree-*-x86_64-linux.tar.gz` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/tobi/disktree/releases/latest), unpack
it, and run `./install.sh` inside (or just copy `disktree` onto your
`PATH`). Or build it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tobi/disktree
cd disktree
make install
```

`make install` builds a release binary and puts three things under `~/.local`
(no root needed):

- `~/.local/bin/disktree`
- a desktop entry, so disktree is in the launcher and in a file manager's
  **Open with** for a directory (it adds a handler; it never becomes the
  default)
- an icon

`sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local` installs system-wide; `make uninstall`
removes exactly what was installed.

You need Rust 1.97 or newer and a Wayland or X11 session with a GPU that GPUI
can drive (Vulkan).

## Use

```sh
disktree            # scan the home directory
disktree --disk     # the whole disk it lives on
disktree ~/src      # or any directory
disktree --help     # options: apparent size, follow links, skip hidden, …
```

### The screen

- **Top:** the trail from `/`, then what is measured — **Size**, **Files** or
  **Age**, **Hidden files**, **Apparent size**, and the depth drawn. In the
  tree a crumb goes there, and its ▾ lists its siblings, largest first with
  their share and size, to jump sideways (arrows and Enter work too). Above
  the scanned root a crumb is dimmer, and clicking it widens the scan to
  there (see below).
- **Under it:** the scan totals, the filter when one is typed, and the legend.
- **Mosaic:** colour is the *kind* of data — code, agent scratch,
  toolchains, synced files, git, media, documents, caches — at one muted
  level, lighter with depth. A diagonal hatch is space that can be had back
  (caches, sync history, package stores, build output), independent of
  colour. Top-level directories carry a strip of their colour and a name
  band; deeper open directories a slim label row. In **Age** mode colour is
  the last write instead, from this week to older.
- **Panel:** the selection (its size set large, share of the scan, files,
  last write, and for a checkout what git says — changes, stashes, unpushed
  commits); *Worth a look*, the largest things that could plausibly go;
  what is marked; and the disk, free now and after the marks, with the way
  to the review screen. Drag its left edge to resize it; double-click the
  edge to reset.

One colour is kept apart: amber marks the selection, the main action, and
what can be had back.

The kinds come from directory names and a few shapes (a bare git repository,
`target` beside a `Cargo.toml`). Some of the names are specific to one
machine; see `crates/disktree-core/src/classify.rs`.

### Marking

Space, X, Enter and the arrows act on the tile under the mouse if the mouse
moved last, and on the keyboard selection after you use an arrow or Tab.

A marked tile takes the danger colour, and so does everything inside it:
removing a directory takes its contents with it. Marking a directory absorbs
any marks already inside it, and something inside a marked directory cannot be
marked or kept on its own; its panel offers to unmark the directory instead.
Marking is reversible — press it again — and the saving is never counted twice.

### Zooming and going in

Scroll to magnify toward the pointer. The wheel magnifies until the directory
under the pointer fills the view, and the next notch goes into it — one
continuous motion, with the directory's contents growing into place. Scroll the
other way to come back out. Enter goes into the selected directory at any
depth, and Backspace or Escape goes up one level. `+` and `-` magnify without
going in; `0` resets.

### Removing

`c` (or **Review…**) opens the list of everything marked. Unmark anything
there, then choose:

- **Move to trash** — the default when a trash is available (`trash-put` from
  trash-cli, then `gio trash`, then a built-in XDG trash). Recoverable until
  the trash is emptied, so it commits directly.
- **Delete permanently** — `rm -rf` semantics. It always asks first, in a dialog
  that names what goes and how much comes back.
