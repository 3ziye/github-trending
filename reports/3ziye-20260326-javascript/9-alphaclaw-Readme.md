<p align="center">AlphaClaw wraps <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">OpenClaw</a> with a convenient setup wizard, self-healing watchdog, Git-backed rollback, and full browser-based observability. Ships with anti-drift prompt hardening to keep your agent disciplined, and simplifies integrations (e.g. Google Workspace, Google Pub/Sub, Telegram Topics, Slack, Discord) so you can manage multiple agents from one UI instead of config files.</p>

> **Platform:** AlphaClaw currently targets Docker/Linux deployments. macOS local development is not yet supported.

## Features

- **Setup UI:** Password-protected web dashboard for onboarding, configuration, and day-to-day management.
- **Guided Onboarding:** Step-by-step setup wizard — model selection, provider credentials, GitHub repo, channel pairing.
- **Multi-Agent Management:** Sidebar-driven agent navigation with create, rename, and delete flows. Per-agent overview cards, channel bindings, and URL-driven agent selection.
- **Gateway Manager:** Spawns, monitors, restarts, and proxies the OpenClaw gateway as a managed child process.
- **Watchdog:** Crash detection, crash-loop recovery, auto-repair (`openclaw doctor --fix`), Telegram/Discord/Slack notifications, and a live interactive terminal for monitoring gateway output directly from the browser.
- **Channel Orchestration:** Telegram, Discord, and Slack bot pairing with per-agent channel bindings, credential sync, and a guided wizard for splitting Telegram into multi-threaded topic groups as your usage grows.
- **Google Workspace:** OAuth integration for Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Tasks, Contacts, and Meet, plus guided Gmail watch setup with Google Pub/Sub topic, subscription, and push endpoint handling.
- **Cron Jobs:** Dedicated cron tab with job management, an interactive rolling calendar, run-history drilldowns, trend analytics, and per-run usage breakdowns.
- **Nodes:** Guided local-node setup for VPS deployments with per-node browser attach checks, reconnect commands, and routing/pairing controls.
- **Webhooks:** Named webhook endpoints with per-hook transform modules, request logging, payload inspection, editable delivery destinations, and OAuth callback support for third-party auth flows.
- **File Explorer:** Browser-based workspace explorer with file visibility, inline edits, diff view, and Git-aware sync for quick fixes without SSH.
- **Prompt Hardening:** Ships anti-drift bootstrap prompts (`AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`) injected into your agent's system prompt on every message — enforcing safe practices, commit discipline, and change summaries out of the box.
- **Git Sync:** Automatic hourly commits of your OpenClaw workspace to GitHub with configurable cron schedule. Combined with prompt hardening, every agent action is version-controlled and auditable.
- **Version Management:** In-place updates for both AlphaClaw and OpenClaw with in-app release notes, changelog review, and one-click apply.
- **Codex OAuth:** Built-in PKCE flow for OpenAI Codex CLI model access.

## Why AlphaClaw

- **Zero to production in one deploy:** Railway/Render templates ship a complete stack — no manual gateway setup.
- **Self-healing:** Watchdog detects crashes, enters repair mode, relaunches the gateway, and notifies you.
- **Everything in the browser:** No SSH, no config files to hand-edit, no CLI required after first deploy.
- **Stays out of the way:** AlphaClaw manages infrastructure; OpenClaw handles the AI.

## No Lock-in. Eject Anytime.

AlphaClaw simply wraps OpenClaw, it's not a dependency. Remove AlphaClaw and your agent keeps running. Nothing proprietary, n
