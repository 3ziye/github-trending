## Backstory

This repo is maintained by **lobsters/claws**, not by a conventional human-only dev team.

The people behind the system are [Bellman / Yeachan Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo) and friends like [Yeongyu](https://github.com/code-yeongyu), but the repo itself is being pushed forward by autonomous claw workflows: parallel coding sessions, event-driven orchestration, recovery loops, and machine-readable lane state.

In practice, that means this project is not just *about* coding agents — it is being **actively built by them**. Features, tests, telemetry, docs, and workflow hardening are landed through claw-driven loops using [clawhip](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/clawhip), [oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent), [oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode), and [oh-my-codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex).

This repository exists to prove that an open coding harness can be built **autonomously, in public, and at high velocity** — with humans setting direction and claws doing the grinding.

## Porting Status

The main source tree is now Python-first.

- `src/` contains the active Python porting workspace
- `tests/` verifies the current Python workspace
- the exposed snapshot is no longer part of the tracked repository state

The current Python workspace is not yet a complete one-to-one replacement for the original system, but the primary implementation surface is now Python.

## Why this rewrite exists

I originally studied the exposed codebase to understand its harness, tool wiring, and agent workflow. After spending more time with the legal and ethical questions—and after reading the essay linked below—I did not want the exposed snapshot itself to remain the main tracked source tree.

This repository now focuses on Python porting work instead.

## Python Workspace Overview

The new Python `src/` tree currently provides:

- **`port_manifest.py`** — summarizes the current Python workspace structure
- **`models.py`** — dataclasses for subsystems, modules, and backlog state
- **`commands.py`** — Python-side command port metadata
- **`tools.py`** — Python-side tool port metadata
- **`query_engine.py`** — renders a Python porting su
