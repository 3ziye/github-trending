## :loudspeaker: News!
- **[2025/09/22]** We released our codes! An enhanced **Pro** version is also released (this version conforms to the pipeline in the original paper, but is optimized in implementation). Everyone is welcome to use it!üéâ
- **[2025/09/13]** Our paper won the ü•á**first place** in the [daily list](https://huggingface.co/papers/date/2025-09-12), the ü•à**second place** in the [weekly list](https://huggingface.co/papers/week/2025-W37), and ü•â**third place** in the [Monthly list](https://huggingface.co/papers/month/2025-09) in HF! ‚≠ê
- **[2025/09/12]** We released the original version of the VLA-Adapter for four LIBERO models on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/VLA-Adapter).
- **[2025/09/11]** We released our paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372).

## :black_nib: TODO List<a name="todo"></a>

- [x]  Release **checkpoints** for reproduction.
- [x]  Release [VLA-Adapter v2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09372).
- [ ]  A more **powerful version**, **VLA-Adapter++**, and a detailed **technical report** üìù will be released soon.<br/>
- [ ]  Continue to update the code to adapt to various **real-world systems** deployments, including the configuration of our paper, Franka, UR-5, and AGILE Piper.<br/>
- [ ]  It will soon be compatible with **various foundation models**, including but not limited to [VPP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14803), [œÄ0.5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16054).<br/>
- [ ]  We will update the **diffusion transformers** and **flow matching** policy networks in the future, and the results will be updated in the subsequent VLA-Adapter++ technical report.
- [ ]  We will also update and give more experiments on **Frozen backbone**.
- [ ]  We will expand its **generalization** further in the future. Work is in progress! So please stay tuned!
- [ ]  **RL post-training** is also in progress. Interested researchers are welcome to join us in building this foundation!
- [ ]  **The dual-system compatibility** of VLA-Adapter is under exploration!
