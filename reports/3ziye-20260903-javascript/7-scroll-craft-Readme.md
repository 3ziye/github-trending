# scroll-craft

**A Claude Code skill that builds premium, scroll-driven websites, and holds them to a real design standard.**

Most AI website output fails in one of two directions. It is either well behaved and forgettable, or it is a flashy scroll animation with 2.1:1 body text, a headline that wraps to six lines on a phone, and the same six sections every other AI page has. scroll-craft is built to fail neither way: it treats **interaction** and **craft** as one job rather than two.

## Three builds, three completely different pages

Same skill, same engine, no shared skeleton. The differences below are not themes: they are different page grammars, different navigation models, different endings.

### [AI Automation Society](https://aiautomationsociety.ai) · an AI community
A dark editorial landing for a 450,000-member community. One stat carries the whole promise, a live product surface rises into the frame, and the proof stacks under it as you fall down the page.

### [Nate Herk](https://www.nateherk.com) · a creator portfolio
High-key and bright, the opposite of the first. A lit-glass hero with the numbers up front, a portrait held in the light, and two clear next steps instead of a wall of links.

### PERKFORM · a protein coffee
A filmic one-shot that hard-cuts to two full-bleed inverted grounds mid-page. Loud, product-forward, and the only one of the three that raises its voice.

## What it actually does

**Interaction, engagement, and being unrepeatable**

- **Scroll is the timeline.** Video scrubs frame by frame under the wheel, sections pin while their argument advances, rails pan sideways, headlines assemble line by line, the page ground shifts colour as you travel, and the pointer moves things that are not scrolling.
- **Eight mutually exclusive page grammars.** Filmic one-shot, chaptered editorial, live surface, continuous world, typographic poster, gallery, split stage, rhythmic cutlist. Each one *forbids* what the others require, so two builds cannot quietly converge.
- **A required signature move.** Every build invents one bespoke interaction that exists on that site alone. A recoloured spotlight does not count.
- **A fingerprint gate.** A new build must differ from every page you have already made on at least 4 of 6 dimensions: grammar, nav, hero, act shape, close, signature move. Fail it and you change the plan, not the record.

**Craft, and how the page actually feels**

- **A feeling curve before any act exists.** One line per act: the emotion, then what on screen causes it. Two adjacent acts with the same feeling means one is filler.
- **One engineered peak.** Peak-end rule, applied literally. The peak gets the asset budget, the silence in front of it, and the most scroll room. A page with three peaks has none.
- **A typography floor.** Two families maximum, tracking that tightens as size grows, 45 to 75ch measure, line height inverse to measure, and light-on-dark compensated on three axes.
- **A spacing scale with actual rhythm.** 4px base, more space above a heading than below it, fluid section padding so a phone does not inherit desktop air.
- **Colour with six roles and one accent**, secondary text tinted rather than flat grey, no pure black, and a documented escape for pages that hard-cut between light and dark grounds.
- **Depth as five tools, not one.** Offset shadows, edge light, scale-and-blur as distance, overlap, and grain.
- **Brand guidelines are inputs, not decoration.** Point it at a brand kit and its hard rules win, including rules that forbid things the skill would otherwise reach for.
- **A refuse list.** Identical feature-card grids, `01 / 06` counters, scroll cues, gradient text, em dashes, invented statistics, fake dashboards, AI-purple gradients, and the cream-and-brass artisan palette every craft brand defaults to.

**It checks its own work**

A headless browser walks the finished page at every scroll position, waits for the video playhead to settle, and reports:

- **dead scroll**: scroll that changes nothing on screen
- **cues that never reach full opacity**: copy the reader can only ever see faded
- **contrast measured on the composited page**, per line, at the brightest frame that ever passes under it, with the direction picked per line so light-on-dark and dark-on-light are both graded correctly
- **legs stuck on a poster**: a clip that silently never decoded, which looks exactly like a paused film

Then it writes a contact sheet, because a machine can prove a page works and cannot tell you it means anything.
