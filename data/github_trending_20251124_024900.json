We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.\n\n**Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity.** Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges. \n\n## Quick Example\n\nA basic Valdi component:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends Component {\n  onRender() {\n    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';\n    <view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}>\n      <label color='black' value={message} />\n    </view>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./docs/docs/assets/start-about/IMG_1445.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Hello World example running on iOS\" />\n</p>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**Prerequisites:** Xcode (macOS only) - everything else is automatic!\n\n```bash\n# Install Valdi CLI\nnpm install -g @snap/valdi\n\n# One-command setup (installs all dependencies)\nvaldi dev_setup\n\n# Create your first project\nmkdir my_project && cd my_project\nvaldi bootstrap\nvaldi install ios  # or android\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **Editor Extensions:** For the best development experience, install the [Valdi VSCode/Cursor extensions](./docs/INSTALL.md#vscodecursor-setup-optional-but-recommended) for syntax highlighting, debugging, and device logs during hot reload.\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](./docs/INSTALL.md)\n- [Documentation](./docs/README.md)\n- [Codelabs](./docs/docs/start-code-lab.md)\n- [API Reference](./docs/api/api-quick-reference.md)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](./docs/docs/faq.md)\n- [Component Library](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi_Widgets)\n\n## Why Choose Valdi?\n\nValdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.\n\n### True Native Performance\n\nUnlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:\n\n- **[Automatic view recycling](./docs/docs/performance-view-recycling.md)** - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency\n- **Optimized component rendering** - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates\n- **Optimized layout engine** - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead\n- **Viewport-aware rendering** - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default\n\nLearn more in our [Performance Optimization Guide](./docs/docs/performance-optimization.md).\n\n### Developer Experience Built for Speed\n\nValdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:\n\n- **Instant hot reload** - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling\n- **[Full VSCode debugging](./docs/docs/workflow-hermes-debugger.md)** - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode\n- **Familiar syntax** - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety\n\n### Flexible Adoption Model\n\nValdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:\n\n- **[Embed Valdi in native](./docs/docs/native-bindings.md)** - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies\n- **[Embed native in Valdi](./docs/docs/native-customviews.md)** - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via `<custom-view>`\n- **[Polyglot modules](./docs/docs/native-polyglot.md)** - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript\n- **[Full-stack architecture](./docs/docs/advanced-full-stack.md)** - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code\n\n### Deep Native Integration\n\nValdi ",

[(docs)](#initialize-the-godot-instance)\n* When restarting, the engine can be reconfigured, so a different Godot app may be loaded each time. [(docs)](#stop-the-godot-instance)\n* It is also possible to pause and resume the running Godot instance. [(docs)](#pause-the-godot-instance)\n* Godot is running on a separate thread, so it does not affect the main thread of the application nor the React Native JavaScript thread. [(docs)](#threading-and-javascript-in-react-native)\n* The Godot main window and any subwindows created by the Godot app may be embedded into the React Native application either on the same screen, or on separate screens (see [example app](example/)).\n* The whole Godot API is accessible from TypeScript / JavaScript. It is possible to instantiate objects, call methods, get and set properties, attach JS functions to signals, provide JS functions as callables to Godot methods ... etc. [(docs)](#godot-api-usage)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33266f05-d733-4c1d-ab49-edaaf426e3e1\" width=\"600\" controls></video>\n</p>\n\n# Getting Started with the Example App\n\nThe [example app](example/) shows the main features of React Native Godot in action.\n\n## Install Prerequisites\n\nDuring development we use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage most external dependencies required for React Native development, like Node, Java, Gradle or Ruby. If you also use ASDF, just run:\n\n```sh\nasdf install\n```\n    \nThis will make sure that all the dependencies are the same like in our environment. Otherwise you may also install React Native prerequisites using any other method.\n\n## Export the Godot app\n\nRun the following scripts for either platform you plan to test (or both):\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh ios\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh ios\n```\n\nThe script is configured to look for Godot in the standard system wide installation folder on macOS. If your Godot is installed elsewhere, or you are on Linux, just point the `GODOT_EDITOR`\nenvironment variable to your Godot editor prior to running the above scripts:\n\n```sh\nexport GODOT_EDITOR=/path/to/godot_editor\n```\n\n## Configure and download LibGodot\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThese commands will resolve all the React Native and other dependencies from npm. The second one will download the prebuilt LibGodot release from GitHub.\n\n## Run on the iOS Simulator\n\n```sh\ncd example/ios\nbundle install\nbundle exec pod install\ncd ..\nyarn ios\n```\n\n## Run on the Android Emulator\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn android\n```\n\n## Use your native IDEs\n\nYou may use Xcode and Android Studio the same way as with any other project. Just open:\n\n* ``ios/GodotTest.xcworkspace`` from Xcode\n* ``android`` from Android Studio\n\n> [!note]\n> If you are using ASDF to manage your Java and Node dependencies, you should start Android Studio from under the `react-native-godot` (or `example`) folder, so it can find these tools. For example on macOS:\n\n```sh\ncd example\nopen -a \"Android Studio\"\n```\n\n## Convenience script for dependency management\n\nThere is an `update_deps.sh` script included in the example app's folder. It will execute all the setup commands for both iOS and Android in one step, so you may start your work immediately.\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./update_deps.sh\nyarn ios # or yarn android\n```\n\n# Your first React Native Godot App\n\nBorn React Native Godot is distributed on npm.\n\nJust follow these steps to add it to your React Native application:\n\n## Update `package.json`\n\n```sh\nyarn add @borndotcom/react-native-godot\n```\n\n## Download the prebuilt LibGodot packages\n\nThe LibGodot packages used by React Native Godot are not distributed on npm. Instead, they are downloaded separately by issuing the following command:\n\n```sh\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThis way React Native Godot can be updated independently from LibGodot, and also local, customized builds of LibGodot are supported.\n\n## Import React Native Godot in your App code\n\n```typescript\nimport { RTNGodot, RTNGodotView, runOnGodotThread } from \"@borndotcom/react-native-godot\";\n```\n\n## Add the Godot View to your view, e.g.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <RTNGodotView style={...}/>\n    </View>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIf no `windowName` property is specified, that view is fo",

[done] Complete 3D Lidar SLAM, fast LIO front-end (AA-FasterLIO), standard\n2. [done] 3D to 2D map conversion (g2p5), optional, if selected outputs real-time 2D grid map, can be saved\n3. [done] Real-time loop closure detection, standard, performs back-end loop closure detection and correction if\n   selected\n4. [done] Smooth high-precision 3D Lidar localization, standard\n5. [done] Dynamic loading scheme for map partitions, suitable for large-scale scenes\n6. [done] Localization with separate dynamic and static layers, adaptable to dynamic scenes, selectable strategies for\n   dynamic layer, optional, if selected saves dynamic layer map content, three strategies available (short-term,\n   medium-term, permanent), default is permanent\n7. [done] High-frequency IMU smooth output, standard, 100Hz\n8. GPS geoinformation association, optional (TODO)\n9. Vehicle odometry input, optional (TODO)\n10. [done] Lightweight optimization library miao and incremental optimization (derived from g2o, but lighter and faster,\n    supports incremental optimization, no need to rebuild optimization model), standard, used in both loop closure and\n    localization\n11. [done] Two verification schemes: offline and online. Offline allows breakpoint debugging with strong consistency.\n    Online allows multi-threaded concurrency, fast processing speed, dynamic frame skipping, and low resource usage.\n12. [done] High-frequency output based on extrapolator and smoother, adjustable smoothing factor\n13. [done] High-performance computing: All the above features can run using less than one CPU core on the pure CPU\n    side (online localization 0.8 cores, mapping 1.2 cores, 32-line LiDAR, without UI).\n\n## Updates\n\n1. 2025.11.13\n\n- Fix two logic typos in FasterLIO.\n- Add global height constraint that can be configured in loop_closing.with_height. If set true, lightning-lm will keep\n  the output map into the same height to avoid the Z-axis drifting in large scenes. It should not be set if you are\n  using lightning-lm in scenes that have multi-floor or stairs structures.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Mapping on the VBR campus dataset:\n\n  ![](./doc/slam_vbr.gif)\n\n- Localization on VBR\n\n  ![](./doc/lm_loc_vbr_campus.gif)\n\n- Map on VBR\n    - Point Cloud\n\n  ![](./doc/campus_vbr.png)\n    - Grid Map\n\n  ![](./doc/campus.png)\n\n- Localization on the NCLT dataset\n\n\n  ![](./doc/lm_loc1_nclt.gif)\n\n\n## Build\n\n### Environment\n\nUbuntu 22.04 or higher.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 should also work, but not tested.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- ros2 humble or above\n- Pangolin (for visualization, see thirdparty)\n- OpenCV\n- PCL\n- yaml-cpp\n- glog\n- gflags\n- pcl_conversions\n\nOn Ubuntu 22.04, run: ```bash ./scripts/install_dep.sh```.\n\n### Build\n\nBuild this package with ```colcon build```.\n\nThen ```source install/setup.bash``` to use it.\n\n### Build Results\n\nAfter building, you will get the corresponding online/offline mapping and localization programs for this package. The\noffline programs are suitable for scenarios with offline data packets to quickly obtain mapping/localization results,\nwhile the online programs are suitable for scenarios with actual sensors to obtain real-time results.\n\nFor example, calling the offline mapping program on the NCLT dataset:\n```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --input_bag ~/data/NCLT/20130110/20130110.db3 --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n\nIf you want to call the online version, just change the offline part to online.\n\n## Testing on Datasets\n\nYou can directly use our converted datasets. If you need the original datasets, you need to convert them to the ros2 db3\nformat.\n\nConverted dataset addresses:\n\n- OneDrive: https://1drv.ms/f/c/1a7361d22c554503/EpDSys0bWbxDhNGDYL_O0hUBa2OnhNRvNo2Gey2id7QMQA?e=7Ui0f5\n- BaiduYun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XmFitUtnkKa2d0YtWquQXw?pwd=xehn 提取码: xehn \n\nOriginal dataset addresses:\n\n- NCLT dataset: http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/\n- UrbanLoco dataset: https://github.com/weisongwen/UrbanLoco\n- VBR dataset: https://www.rvp-group.net/slam-dataset.html\n\n### Mapping Test\n\n1. Real-time mapping (real-time bag playback)\n    - Start the mapping program:\n      ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_online --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n    - Play the data bag\n    - Save the map ```ros2 service call /lightning/save_map lightning/srv/SaveMap \"{map_id: new_map}\"```\n2. Offline mapping (traverse data, faster)\n    - ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml --input_bag [bag_file]```\n    - It will automatically save to the data/new_map directory after finishing.\n3. Viewing the map\n    - View the full map: ```pcl_viewer ./data/new_map/global.pcd```\n    - The actual map is stored in blocks, global.pcd is only for displaying the result.\n    - map.pgm stores the 2D grid map information.\n    - Note that during the localization program run or upon exit, results for dynamic lay",

HipKittens features the following types of primitives. \n1. **Tile primitives**: sized according to the tensor core units. Tile memory ops are coalesced, bank conflict free, and eagerly use tensor core layouts. We focus on minimizing address computation costs. \n2. **Python-inspired functions**: bulk compute functions that operate over tiles. These are lightweight, wrapping assembly and HIP.\n3. **Asynchronous loads/stores**: hide latencies and address generation using direct buffer loads to shared memory.\n4. **Scheduling and overlapping**: we show two core patterns for overlapping compute and memory, 8-wave ping pong and 4-wave interelave, that appear across kernels.\n\nWe support CDNA3 and CDNA 4. \n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo\ngit clone git@github.com:HazyResearch/HipKittens.git\n**or**\ngit clone https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens.git\n\n# obtain an amd docker using docker pull or podman pull\npodman pull docker.io/rocm/7.0-preview:rocm7.0_preview_pytorch_training_mi35x_beta\n\n# enter the docker\npodman run -it \\\n    --ipc=host \\\n    --network=host \\\n    --privileged \\\n    --cap-add=CAP_SYS_ADMIN \\\n    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \\\n    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \\\n    --device=/dev/kfd \\\n    --device=/dev/dri \\\n    -v $(pwd):/workdir/ \\\n    -e USE_FASTSAFETENSOR=1 \\\n    -e SAFETENSORS_FAST_GPU=1 \\\n    rocm/7.0-preview:rocm7.0_preview_pytorch_training_mi35x_beta \\\n    bash\n\n# set the environment variables\ncd HipKittens/\nsource env.src\n\n# install aiter (baseline kernels)\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git\ncd aiter\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n## Unit tests\n\nWe provide unit tests for you to optionally test the correctness of library functions. \n\n```bash\ncd HipKittens/tests/unit\nmake -j64\n```\n\n## Quick start: running kernels\n\nWe assume you will run the following on an MI350X or MI355X unless otherwise specified.

      "readme": "# FlashMoBA\n\nFlashMoBA is a memory-efficient sparse attention mechanism designed to accelerate the training and inference of long-sequence models. This repository provides the official implementation of FlashMoBA from the following paper, which is implemented based on [FlashAttention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) 2.8.3 and is inspired by [MoBA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13189).\n\n![FlashMoBA](assets/flash_moba_attention.png)\n\n**Optimizing Mixture of Block Attention**  \nGuangxuan Xiao<sup>&#42;</sup>, Junxian Guo<sup>&#42;</sup>, Kasra Mazaheri, Song Han\n\nPaper: [Optimizing Mixture of Block Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11571)\n\n## News\n\n- [2025/11] We release the implementation of FlashMoBA 2.0.0, which is implemented based on FlashAttention 2.8.3.\n\n## Installation\n**Requirements:**\n- CUDA toolkit 12.9 and above (we need the support of 64-bit offset in `DeviceSegmentedSort` from [NVIDIA/cccl#3308](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/pull/3308)).\n- PyTorch 2.8 and above.\n- `packaging` Python package (`pip install packaging`)\n- `ninja` Python package (`pip install ninja`)\n- Linux.\n\n\\* Make sure `ninja` is installed and discoverable. You can verify this by running `ninja --version` and checking its exit code. If it returns a non-zero exit code, we recommend reinstalling it (`pip uninstall -y ninja && pip install ninja`). Without `ninja`, compilation can be very slow as it won't parallelize across CPU cores. With `ninja`, compilation typically takes 3-5 minutes on a multi-core machine.\n\n**To install:**\n```sh\nMAX_JOBS=32 python setup.py install\n```\n\n**Interface:** `flash_moba/flash_moba_interface.py`\n\n## How to use FlashMoBA\n\nFlashMoBA operates on variable-length sequences packed into single tensors. This format avoids wasting computation on padding tokens and is highly efficient.\n\nThe primary entry point is `flash_moba_varlen_func`. This function is a convenient wrapper that first computes the sparse attention pattern based on the Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) algorithm, and then performs the attention computation.\n\n```python\nfrom flash_moba import flash_moba_varlen_func\n\ndef flash_moba_varlen_func(\n    q,\n    k,\n    v,\n    cu_seqlens_q,\n    cu_seqlens_k,\n    max_seqlen_q,\n    max_seqlen_k,\n    moba_chunk_size,\n    moba_topk,\n    causal=True,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is the main entry point for FlashMoBA. It first computes the sparse\n    attention pattern based on Mixture-of-Blocks Attention (MOBA) and then performs\n    the attention computation. This function is designed for variable length sequences.\n\n    Arguments:\n        q: (total_q, nheads, headdim), where total_q = total number of query tokens in the batch.\n        k: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.\n        v: (total_k, nheads_k, headdim), where total_k = total number of key tokens in the batch.\n        cu_seqlens_q: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths\n           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into q.\n        cu_seqlens_k: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths\n           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into kv.\n        max_seqlen_q: int. Maximum query sequence length in the batch.\n        max_seqlen_k: int. Maximum key sequence length in the batch.\n        moba_chunk_size: int. The chunk size for MOBA.\n        moba_topk: int. The number of top-k key blocks to select for each query block.\n        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask. Default to True.\n\n    Return:\n        out: (total_q, nheads, headdim).\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nFor more advanced use cases that require finer control, FlashMoBA also exposes the two underlying steps as separate functions:\n\n1.  `flash_topk_varlen_func`: Computes the sparse attention pattern (top-k indices).\n2.  `flash_moba_attn_varlen_func`: Performs attention using a pre-computed pattern.\n\nThis two-step approach is useful if you want to inspect the sparse indices or reuse a pattern.\n\n```python\nfrom flash_moba import flash_topk_varlen_func, flash_moba_attn_varlen_func\n\ndef flash_topk_varlen_func(\n    q,\n    k,\n    cu_seqlens_q,\n    cu_seqlens_k,\n    max_seqlen_q,\n    max_seqlen_k,\n    # MOBA sparse pattern parameters\n    moba_topk,\n    moba_chunk_size,\n    causal=False,\n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the top-k indices for Mixture-of-Blocks Attention (MOBA).\n    This function handles variable length sequences.\n\n    Args:\n        q (torch.Tensor): Query tensor of shape (total_q, num_heads, head_size).\n        k (torch.Tensor): Key tensor of shape (total_k, num_heads, head_size).\n        cu_seqlens_q (torch.Tensor): Cumulative sequence lengths for queries, shape (batch_size + 1,).\n        cu_seqlens_k (torch.Tensor): Cumulative sequence lengths for keys, shape (batch_size + 1,).\n        max_seqlen_q (int): Maximum sequence length for queries.\n        max_seqlen_k (int): Maximum sequence length for keys.\n        moba_topk (int): The number of top-k elements to select.\n ",

The game was originally designed for consoles and limits subtitle size above 720p, making text harder to read on 1080p or higher. This fix removes that limit so subtitles scale correctly with your resolution.\n\nIf you want a different size, you can fine-tune it with `FontScalingFactor` in `MadnessPatch.ini`.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/FontScaling_Off.jpg\"></td>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/FontScaling_On.jpg\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">4K Vanilla</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">4K MadnessPatch</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n## High FPS Fixes\n\nFix multiple physics and gameplay issues that occur at high framerates by preventing hair and dress physics from becoming unstable and ensuring consistent hitbox size for projectiles like the Pepper Grinder.\n\n## Crashes and Infinite Loading Fix\n\nPrevents crashes and infinite loading screens caused by race conditions that occur more frequently at higher framerates during map transitions.\n\n## Input Binding Fix\n\nFix issues where certain input mappings fail to respond correctly. This particularly affects the umbrella key and other special action bindings that may not register during the input initialization process.\n\n## Force High Resolution Textures\n\nThe game normally loads blurry textures first and then sharpens them as you get closer, which was meant for consoles but looks distracting on PC. This patch forces the highest texture resolution from the start and improves texture streaming, so you don’t see textures popping into clarity as you move around. It also slightly reduces mipmap bias, improving texture sharpness at a distance.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/ForceHighResTextures_Off.jpg\"></td>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/ForceHighResTextures_On.jpg\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">Vanilla</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">Force High Res</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n> **Note**: May increase VRAM usage and impact performance on systems with limited graphics memory.\n\n## Bink Video Color Space Fix\n\nSwitched the Bink video color profile from BT.601 to BT.709, which is the standard for HD video, so pre-rendered videos now show correct colors, especially deep reds and warm tones.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/FixBinkVideoBT709_Off.jpg\"></td>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/FixBinkVideoBT709_On.jpg\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">Vanilla (BT.601)</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">MadnessPatch (BT.709)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n## Input Improvements\n\n### Disable Mouse Acceleration\n\nStops the game from ramping up mouse speed when you start moving it.\n\n### Disable Controller Acceleration\n\nTurns off the same acceleration system for controllers. The game speeds up your look input as the stick starts moving, and this option removes that so the stick behaves more consistently.\n\nEnable with `DisableControllerAcceleration = 1` in `MadnessPatch.ini`.\n\n### Disable Mouse Smoothing\n\nTurns off camera smoothing so the view responds instantly to your mouse movements.\n\nEnable with `DisableMouseSmoothing = 1` in `MadnessPatch.ini`.\n\n## Ultrawide FOV Fix\n\nRemoves pillarboxing and adjusts the FOV for ultrawide monitors.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/FixUltraWideScreenFOV_Off.",

Direct RIP Hijacking\n```\nOriginal State:          Modified State:\n┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐\n│ RIP: ntdll   │   →    │ RIP: 0x7FFE  │ (shellcode)\n│ RAX: ...     │        │ RAX: ...     │\n└──────────────┘        └──────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Simple and reliable.  \n**Detection Risk**: High - RIP directly pointing to non-module memory is easily detected by EDR thread scanning.\n\n### 2. JMP RAX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE0)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE0    │    →        │ RAX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: RIP points to legitimate ntdll.dll, more stealthy than direct hijacking.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Suspicious RAX value and unusual gadget execution may trigger heuristics.\n\n### 3. JMP RBX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE3)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE3    │    →        │ RBX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Similar to JMP RAX, RIP remains in legitimate module space.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Same as JMP RAX, slightly different register makes detection signatures less common.\n\n### 4. Callback Function Hijacking\n```\nEnumResourceTypesW(hModule, lpEnumFunc, lParam)\n                              ↓\n                   ",

      "readme": "# SILVERPICK\r\n\r\n## VERSION\r\n\r\n- `v1.0`\r\n\r\n## BRIEF\r\n\r\nProject `SILVERPICK` is a `Windows User-Mode Shellcode Development Framework (WUMSDF)` whose sole purpose is to empower capability developers to build `Position Independent Code (PIC)` blobs for `Windows` `x64` using `C/C++` in an easy manner so as to reduce the development costs of such an endeavour.\r\n\r\nIt derives from project [WILDBEAST](https://github.com/winterknife/WILDBEAST) and, as such, leverages:\r\n1. `Visual Studio Code` as the code editor\r\n2. `MinGW-w64` toolchain as the compiler toolchain\r\n3. `GNU Make` as the build system\r\n\r\n## SETUP\r\n\r\nYou may find the setup instructions from here: [GCC-Clang-Setup-Windows](https://gist.github.com/winterknife/0b177a75a55bad895b19aad64cffa14f)\r\n\r\nPlease note that this project is using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).\r\n\r\n## FEATURES\r\n\r\nWriting shellcode in higher-level programming languages is nothing new, and countless blog posts and research papers have been published on the same since 2010. So, what is new in `SILVERPICK`?\r\n\r\nWell, I am glad that you asked.\r\n\r\n`SILVERPICK` has a nice little bag of tricks hidden up its sleeve, but most of all, this is my take on the subject.\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, I present to you my first trick.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 01\r\n\r\nEver since Matt Graeber popularised writing shellcode in `C`, most people have been using his [16-byte stack alignment stub written in `Assembly` language](https://github.com/mattifestation/PIC_Bindshell/blob/master/PIC_Bindshell/AdjustStack.asm).\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a problem, seeing as how we aren't `IKEA`, assembly should not be necessary, and indeed it is not.\r\n\r\nThere exists a [`GCC` Function Attribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html) that will emit the stack alignment stub for you.\r\n\r\nMeet the `force_align_arg_pointer` function attribute in the form of a helpful [ALIGN_STACK](/Inc/Common.h#L84) macro, which generates the following assembly:\r\n```asm\r\nDisassembly of section .init:\r\n\r\n<PicEntry>:\r\n\tpush   rbp\r\n\tmov    rbp,rsp\r\n\tand    rsp,0xfffffffffffffff0\r\n\tsub    rsp,0x20\r\n\tcall   <PicEntry+0x11>\tIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32\t.text$payload\r\n\tleave\r\n\tret\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's the `.init` section, you ask? Well, that serves as a nice segue into my second trick.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 02\r\n\r\nMatt Graeber might have popularised writing shellcode in `C` at some point, but really, it was Paul Ungur who revived this black art with [Stardust](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Stardust).\r\n\r\nNow, `Stardust` uses a [Binutils linker script](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html) to control the placement of functions and data into the appropriate `PE` section in the correct order. This technique itself is derived from Austin Hudson's work, and many people use a variant of his linker scripts.\r\n\r\nWhile linker scripts are great for linker section ordering, if all you need is to place a certain function at the beginning of the code section, they are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nEnter the `section` function attribute with a special section name called `.init`, which indicates to the linker that the function contains pre-`main()` runtime initialization code and must be _first_ in the link order.\r\n\r\nTo this effect, the [CODE_BEGIN](/Inc/Common.h#L81) macro has been created.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 03\r\n\r\nFor my third trick, I present to you the [STACK_STRING](/Inc/StackString.h#L35) macro.\r\n\r\nIn `C`, you can create a stack string (a string that is dynamically built on the stack) by declaring the string literal as an array of `ANSI` characters:\r\n```c\r\nchar charrHelloKitty[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'K', 'i', 't', 't', 'y', '\\0' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `C++`, you can create a stack string by simply marking a `char` array as `constexpr`:\r\n```cpp\r\nconstexpr char charrHelloKitty[]{ \"HelloKitty\" };\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, both of these techniques are rendered useless in the face of compiler optimizations _if_ the string literals are sufficiently large, unlike our solution, which will work regardless of the string length and the level of compiler optimizations, thanks to some clever `C++` template metaprogramming hack courtesy of Can Bölük.\r\n\r\nUsing this macro is pretty straightforward:\r\n```c\r\nSTACK_STRING(sstrText, \"an extra long hello world!\");\r\nSTACK_STRING(sstrCaption, \"Demo\");\r\n\r\nMessageBoxA(nullptr, sstrText.data(), sstrCaption.data(), MB_OK);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the following assembly:\r\n```asm\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_23], 61h ; 'a'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_22], 6Eh ; 'n'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_21], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_20], 65h ; 'e'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1F], 78h ; 'x'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1E], 74h ; 't'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1D], 72h ; 'r'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1C], 61h ; 'a'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1B], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1A], 6Ch ; 'l'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_19], 6Fh ; 'o'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_18], 6Eh ; 'n'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_17], 67h ; 'g'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_16], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_15], 68h ; 'h'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_14], 65h ; 'e'\r\nmov     [r",

      "readme": "# VEH-Based Function Call Obfuscation\n\nObfuscating function calls using Vectored Exception Handlers by redirecting execution through exception-based control flow. Uses byte switching without memory or assembly allocation.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe implementation intercepts function calls by intentionally triggering CPU exceptions instead of using traditional jumps. When a protected function is called, Windows triggers a `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exception. The Vectored Exception Handler catches this exception before normal execution continues, checks if the instruction pointer (RIP/EIP) matches a registered hook entry, and redirects execution to a hook function by modifying the CPU context.\n\nFor persistent hooking, a trap flag is set after redirection. This triggers a `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP` exception after one instruction executes, allowing the handler to automatically restore the PAGE_GUARD protection (since Windows clears it after each violation). This ensures the hook works on every subsequent call without manual intervention.\n\nAn alternative method uses `INT3` breakpoint instructions (byte switching - writing 0xCC) to trigger `STATUS_BREAKPOINT` exceptions for control flow obfuscation, hiding function calls and jumps behind exception handling logic.\n\n**Key Point**: All operations use byte switching - modifying existing code bytes in-place using `vxmovememory()`. No memory allocation, no assembly generation required.\n\n## Two Obfuscation Methods\n\n### Guard Page Violation Method\nProtects target function addresses with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ | PAGE_GUARD` memory protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`. Each function call triggers a guard page violation exception, which the VEH handler intercepts to redirect execution. The handler modifies RIP/EIP bytes in the CPU context structure.\n\n### INT3 Breakpoint Method  \nPlaces `INT3` (0xCC) instruction at target addresses by switching the first byte to 0xCC. Execution hits the breakpoint, triggers `STATUS_BREAKPOINT`, and the handler redirects control flow to obfuscated paths. Uses `NtFlushInstructionCache` to flush CPU cache after byte modification.\n\n## Using the VEH Obfuscation\n\n- Example in ebytesyscalls.cpp\n\n## Key Functions\n\n- `vehhook::initialize()` - Registers the VEH exception handler with Windows\n- `vehhook::addhook(entry)` - Adds hook entry and sets PAGE_GUARD protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n- `vehhook::removehook(entry)` - Removes hook and restores memory protection\n- `vehhook::findhook(address)` - Finds hook entry by original function address\n- `vehhook::triggerint3hook(target, redirect, entry)` - Installs INT3 breakpoint (switches byte to 0xCC) for control flow obfuscation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe exception handler processes three exception types in order:\n\n1. **STATUS_BREAKPOINT** - INT3 breakpoint hits, redirects execution by modifying RIP/EIP\n2. **STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION** - Guard page accessed, redirects and sets trap flag (EFlags |= 0x100)\n3. **STATUS_SINGLE_STEP** - Trap flag triggered, restores PAGE_GUARD for all hooks via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Memory protection changes use `NtProtectVirtualMemory` via `internals::getprocaddr()` - this is **NOT a direct syscall**, it's the Nt* API resolved dynamically\n- Function addresses are resolved through manual PE parsing via `internals::getprocaddr()` instead of `GetProcAddress()`\n- All byte modifications use `vxmovememory()` - no standard library memory functions\n- INT3 installation uses byte switching (writes 0xCC) then flushes instruction cache via `NtFlushInstructionCache`\n\n## Byte Switching Approach\n\nUnlike traditional hooking that allocates memory or generates assembly:\n- Guard page method: Only modifies memory protection flags (no code bytes changed)\n- INT3 method: Switches one byte (0xCC) in-place, no allocation needed\n- Both methods: Redirect execution via CPU context modification (RIP/EIP), not code patching\n- Exception handlers: Modify existing CPU register state, no new memory required\n\n## Notes\n\nThe VEH obfuscation technique works by leveraging Windows exception handling infrastructure. Control flow redirection happens in the exception handler, making static analysis more difficult since execution jumps aren't visible in the original code.\n\nYou can combine both methods - use guard page hooks for function interception and INT3 breakpoints for general control flow obfuscation throughout your code.\n\nAll operations use byte switching - modifying existing code or CPU state without allocating new memory or generating assembly instructions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis implementation demonstrates exception-based control flow obfuscation. The technique hides execution flow in exception handlers but can be detected through VEH enumeration, exception frequency analysis, or advanced EDR monitoring. Use as one layer of a multi-layered obfuscation strategy.\n\n# License\n- MIT\n\n\n# Credits \n- AdvDebug for hook -> copymem. (github.com/AdvDebug)\n",

      "readme": "# EtwLeakKernel\n\nThis repository contains a PoC for a program that utilizes ETW to leak kernel memory addresses. It does so by creating a consumer (could be to almost any provider as almost all of them leak kernel addresses) and requesting a stack trace from it. Once the stack trace is received, it is parsed to extract the kernel memory addresses. Since Microsoft do not consider administrator to kernel as a security boundary, this situation won't change any time soon. Might be useful in some exploitation scenarios (**e.g. wanting to leak the kernel base address if you know that an ETW provider leaks a kernel address which is in a certain offset from the kernel base address or any other interesting address for that matter**) or just as a party trick.\n\n**Bare in mind** that administrative privileges are required to *start consuming* from ETW providers. If there is already a program that consumes ETW events that normal user has access to the trace, the normal user will be able to leak kernel addresses as well. It does not provide any leak of actual kernel data, just kernel addresses (unless in maybe an extreme edge cases).\n\n![poc](./Resources/poc.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can see an example of how to use in [EtwLeakKernel](./EtwLeakKernel/EtwLeakKernel.cpp).

[@NickEverdox](https://x.com/nickeverdox/status/1981959428846084269) Decided to release a similar version of the concept, so I might as well release my version that I had come up with independently. The main difference is that I don't rely on on a hardware breakpoint, but rather make the instruction overwrite itself. Emulating this behaviour is also very annoying, because the amount of data copied varies greatly even on the same processor depending on the alignment of source/destination operands and the instruction itself. On machines with E-cores the behaviour can be different even with the same parameters.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid check_ept(const void* address)\n{\n  constexpr uint8_t shellcode[] = {\n    0xFC,                                     // 0:  cld\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xCE,                         // 1:  mov    rsi,rcx\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xD7,                         // 4:  mov    rdi,rdx\n    0x44, 0x89, 0xC1,                         // 7:  mov    ecx, r8d\n    0xF3, 0x48, 0xA5,                         // a:  rep movs QWORD PTR es:[rdi], QWORD PTR ds:[rsi]\n    0xC3                                      // d:  ret\n  };\n  constexpr uint32_t offset_repmov = 0xA;\n\n  const auto code = (char*)VirtualAlloc(nullptr, 0x2000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n  const auto repmov_addr = code + 0x1020;\n  const auto shellcode_addr = repmov_addr - offset_repmov;\n\n  code[0] = 0;\n  memcpy(shellcode_addr, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));\n\n  Sleep(100);\n\n  __try\n  {\n    ((void(*)(const void* src, void* dst, uint32_t cnt))shellcode_addr)(address, code + 0xF00, 0x200 / 8);\n  }\n  __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)\n  {\n  }\n\n  // REP MOVS will overshoot the copy on every platform except when we're faulting every iteration of the instruction due to EPT.\n  bool is_ok = repmov_addr[8] != 0;\n\n  uint32_t overwrite_count = std::count_if(repmov_addr, repmov_addr + 0x100, [](unsigned char c) { return c != 0; });\n  printf(\"OVERWRITES: %u %s\\n\", overwrite_count, is_ok ? \"NOT DETECTED\" : \"DETECTED\");\n\n  VirtualFree(code, 0, MEM_RELEASE);\n}\n```\n",

      "readme": "# Technical Writeup: version.dll Sideloading, Proxying, and Hooking\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document provides a detailed technical analysis of a proof-of-concept that demonstrates DLL sideloading by targeting `OneDrive.exe` with a malicious `version.dll`. This technique is leveraged for achieving persistence, evading defenses, and executing arbitrary code within the context of a trusted process. The proof-of-concept further employs DLL proxying to maintain the normal operation of the host application and utilizes a sophisticated hooking mechanism based on Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and hardware-like breakpoints to intercept and modify application behavior.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### DLL Sideloading\n\nDLL sideloading is a common attack vector where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This is often possible due to the way Windows resolves DLL dependencies, following a specific search order. If an attacker can place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL's location, the malicious library will be loaded. This technique is particularly effective for defense evasion as the malicious code executes under the umbrella of a trusted, and often signed, executable.\n\nIn this proof-of-concept, `OneDrive.exe` is the target application, and `version.dll` is the sideloaded library. Many applications, including `OneDrive.exe`, have a dependency on `version.dll` for retrieving file version information. By placing a custom `version.dll` in the application's directory, we can hijack the loading process.\n\n### DLL Proxying\n\nSimply replacing a required DLL with a malicious one would likely cause the host application to crash if it cannot find the necessary functions (exports) it expects from that DLL. To circumvent this, DLL proxying is employed. The malicious DLL is crafted to export the same functions as the original, legitimate DLL. When the host application calls one of these functions, the proxy DLL can either execute its own malicious code, pass the call through to the original DLL, or both. This maintains the application's stability while allowing the malicious code to operate.\n\nThe `exports.h` file in this project demonstrates this technique. It uses `#pragma comment(linker, \"/export:...\")` directives to forward all the expected exports from the proxy `version.dll` to the legitimate `version.dll` located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`. This ensures that any calls made by `OneDrive.exe` to functions within `version.dll` are correctly handled by the original library, preventing crashes and raising less suspicion.\n\n### API Hooking with Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and PAGE_GUARD\n\nA key component of this proof-of-concept is its advanced method for API hooking. Instead of traditional methods like inline hooking, which can be detected by security products, this implementation uses a more covert technique involving Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and memory page protection.\n\nVEH is a mechanism in Windows that allows developers to register a function to be called whenever an exception occurs in a process. This proof-of-concept intentionally triggers exceptions to gain control of the execution flow.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.  **Installation**: The `InstallHook` function in `hook.cpp` retrieves the address of the target function, `CreateWindowExW`, from `user32.dll`.\n2.  **VEH Registration**: It then registers a custom exception handler, `VectoredHandler`, using `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`.\n3.  **Triggering Exceptions**: The key to this technique is modifying the memory protection of the target function's first byte. `VirtualProtect` is used to add the `PAGE_GUARD` flag to the memory page containing `CreateWindowExW`. When the application attempts to execute this function, a `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exception is raised.\n4.  **Exception Handling**: The `VectoredHandler` catches this specific exception. It then redirects the instruction pointer (`Rip` in the context record) to our malicious function, `HookedCreateWindowExW`.\n5.  **Re-arming the Hook**: After the exception is handled, the `PAGE_GUARD` is removed by the system. To ensure the hook remains active for subsequent calls, the handler also sets the single-step flag (`EFlags |= 0x100`). This causes a `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP` exception after the next instruction executes, which is also caught by our handler. Inside the single-step handler, the `PAGE_GUARD` is reapplied to the original function's memory page.\n\nThis method of hooking is stealthy because it doesn't directly modify the code of the hooked function in a persistent way, making it more difficult for security software to detect.\n\n## Code Breakdown\n\n### `dllmain.cpp`\n\nThis is the entry point of our malicious DLL. When the DLL is loaded into the `OneDrive.exe` process (`DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`), it performs the following actions:\n*   `DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hModule)`: An optimization to prevent the DLL from receiving threa",
