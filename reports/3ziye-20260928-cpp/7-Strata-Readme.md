Strata runs **[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next)** - a large, smart AI model that
normally needs a server - on your own PC. It writes its answers at **60-95 tokens per second** (a token is about ¾
of a word): faster than you can read.

- **Free and open source.**

## How fast is it?

Measured on an RTX 5070 (12 GB), a Ryzen 5 7600 and 64 GB of RAM:

| Size | Writes answers (short chat) | Writes answers (128K context) | Reads your prompt |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 95 tokens/s | 65 tokens/s | 539 tokens/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 78 tokens/s | 52 tokens/s | 463 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 66 tokens/s | 45 tokens/s | 410 tokens/s |
| **IQ3_S** | 54 tokens/s | 42 tokens/s | 374 tokens/s |

- **Writes answers** = how fast the reply appears (tokens per second).
- **Reads your prompt** = how fast it takes in what you send (long documents, code, chat history).

A card with more VRAM is faster, because more of the model fits on the GPU: an RTX 3090 (24 GB) should do roughly
100-140 tokens per second. All measurements, long-context numbers and estimates for other cards are in the
[details](docs/DETAILS.md#speed-measured).

## Which model should I pick?

**The size** (the same model, compressed more or less):

| Model | RAM+VRAM Requirements | Speed | Quality |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| **Q2_0** | 37.6 GB | fastest | good |
| **IQ2_XS** | 39.2 GB | fast | better (**recommended**) |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 47.0 GB | slower | great |
| **IQ3_S** | 54.8 GB | slowest | best: matches the full model on the published tests (original model only) |

**Will it fit?** Shard 1 is the part of the model that gets loaded when it starts: its experts go into your **RAM**,
the rest onto your graphics card (the second shard, a 29 GB lookup table, stays on the SSD). So it fits when your
**RAM is at least shard 1 + about 10 GB** for Windows and your other programs. With 64 GB of RAM every size fits
(IQ3_S with little else open); with 48 GB, Q2_0 and IQ2_XS. A bigger graphics card makes it faster, but it doesn't
lower the RAM needed.

**The version:**

- **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next** - the original.
- **[Swift 1.5](https://huggingface.co/ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)** - a fine-tune by UkisAI
  that thinks much shorter before answering, so you get the answer sooner, with about the same quality. Same speed per
  token, and about the same RAM as the same size of the original (no IQ3_S). Its own license applies (see its page).

Not sure? Take **IQ2_XS**. You can add another one later with `START-HERE.bat --setup`.

## Install

**You need:** an NVIDIA RTX 30, 40 or 50 card with 12 GB of VRAM or more, enough RAM for the size you pick (above),
~80 GB of free disk space (an SSD makes the first start much faster), and Windows 10/11 or Linux. The only thing you
install yourself is a current **NVIDIA driver** ([nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) or the NVIDIA
App). Everything else - Python, the engine, the model - is set up for you.

**Windows**

1. [Download this project](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or `git clone` it).
2. Double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**.
3. Answer a few questions - or just press Enter each time for the recommended choice:
   - **Which model and size?** The original or Swift 1.5, and Q2_0, IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS or IQ3_S - see [above](#which-model-should-i-pick)
   - **How much context?** How much text it can keep in mind at once (it suggests one for your card)
   - **Images?** Whether it should also read pictures
   - **Experimental speed projection?** Off unless you say yes - [read what it does](docs/DETAILS.md#experimental-speed-projection-experimental-off-by-default) first

Then it downloads everything (the model is ~70 GB, so the first time takes a while - you can stop and it picks up
where it left off) and **starts the model**. Your browser opens the Strata app at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

**Next time**, just double-click `START-HERE.bat` again: it starts right away, nothing is downloaded twice. Close its
window t
