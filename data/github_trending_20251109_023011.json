This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.\n\n## Talk to it\n\nTo get a sense of the endpoint of this repo, you can currently find [nanochat d32](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/8) hosted on [nanochat.karpathy.ai](https://nanochat.karpathy.ai/). \"d32\" means that this model has 32 layers in the Transformer neural network. This model has 1.9 billion parameters, it was trained on 38 billion tokens by simply running the single script [run1000.sh](run1000.sh), and the total cost of training was ~$800 (about 33 hours training time on 8XH100 GPU node). While today this is enough to outperform GPT-2 of 2019, it falls dramatically short of modern Large Language Models like GPT-5. When talking to these micro models, you'll see that they make a lot of mistakes, they are a little bit naive and silly and they hallucinate a ton, a bit like children. It's kind of amusing. But what makes nanochat unique is that it is fully yours - fully configurable, tweakable, hackable, and trained by you from start to end. To train and talk to your own, we turn to...\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh), which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:\n\n```bash\nbash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nAlternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session `speedrun` (and also log output to `speedrun.log`):\n\n```bash\nscreen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nSee the [screen cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jctosta/af918e1618682638aa82) if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with `Ctrl-a d` and `tail speedrun.log` to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.chat_web\n```\n\nAnd then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).\n\n---\n\n<img width=\"2672\" height=\"1520\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed39ddf8-2370-437a-bedc-0f39781e76b5\" />\n\n---\n\nYou can also `cat report.md` file which appeared in the project directory and contains the \"report card\" of the run, i.e. a bunch of evaluations and metrics. At the very end, you'll see a summary table, for example:\n\n---\n\n- Characters: 333,989\n- Lines: 8,304\n- Files: 44\n- Tokens (approx): 83,497\n- Dependencies (uv.lock lines): 2,004\n\n| Metric          | BASE     | MID      | SFT      | RL       |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| CORE            | 0.2219   | -        | -        | -        |\n| ARC-Challenge   | -        | 0.2875   | 0.2807   | -        |\n| ARC-Easy        | -        | 0.3561   | 0.3876   | -        |\n| GSM8K           | -        | 0.0250   | 0.0455   | 0.0758   |\n| HumanEval       | -        | 0.0671   | 0.0854   | -        |\n| MMLU            | -        | 0.3111   | 0.3151   | -        |\n| ChatCORE        | -        | 0.0730   | 0.0884   | -        |\n\nTotal wall clock time: 3h51m\n\n---\n\n(Your table might be missing the RL number by default). For a lot more information around the speedrun script and what to look for and expect, please refer to the walkthrough that I posted in Discussions of the repo: [\"Introducing nanochat: The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy\"](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1).\n\n## Bigger models\n\nUnsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~1",

      "readme": "# Kimi CLI\n\n[![Commit Activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/graphs/commit-activity)\n[![Checks](https://img.shields.io/github/check-runs/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/main)](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/actions)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kimi-cli)](https://pypi.org/project/kimi-cli/)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/kimi-cli)](https://pypistats.org/packages/kimi-cli)\n[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)\n\n[中文](https://www.kimi.com/coding/docs/kimi-cli.html)\n\nKimi CLI is a new CLI agent that can help you with your software development tasks and terminal operations.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Kimi CLI is currently in technical preview.\n\n## Key features\n\n- Shell-like UI and raw shell command execution\n- Zsh integration\n- [Agent Client Protocol] support\n- MCP support\n- And more to come...\n\n[Agent Client Protocol]: https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol\n\n## Installation\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Kimi CLI currently only supports macOS and Linux. Windows support is coming soon.\n\nKimi CLI is published as a Python package on PyPI. We highly recommend installing it with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). If you have not installed uv yet, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install it first.\n\nOnce uv is installed, you can install Kimi CLI with:\n\n```sh\nuv tool install --python 3.13 kimi-cli\n```\n\nRun `kimi --help` to check if Kimi CLI is installed successfully.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Due to the security checks on macOS, the first time you run `kimi` command may take 10 seconds or more depending on your system environment.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nUpgrade Kimi CLI to the latest version with:\n\n```sh\nuv tool upgrade kimi-cli --no-cache\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `kimi` command in the directory you want to work on, then send `/setup` to setup Kimi CLI:\n\n![](./docs/images/setup.png)\n\nAfter setup, Kimi CLI will be ready to use. You can send `/help` to get more information.\n\n## Features\n\n### Shell mode\n\nKimi CLI is not only a coding agent, but also a shell. You can switch the mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`. In shell mode, you can directly run shell commands without leaving Kimi CLI.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Built-in shell commands like `cd` are not supported yet.\n\n### Zsh integration\n\nYou can use Kimi CLI together with Zsh, to empower your shell experience with AI agent capabilities.\n\nInstall the [zsh-kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli) plugin via:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \\\n  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are using a plugin manager other than Oh My Zsh, you may need to refer to the plugin's README for installation instructions.\n\nThen add `kimi-cli` to your Zsh plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:\n\n```sh\nplugins=(... kimi-cli)\n```\n\nAfter restarting Zsh, you can switch to agent mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`.\n\n### ACP support\n\nKimi CLI supports [Agent Client Protocol] out of the box. You can use it together with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE.\n\nFor example, to use Kimi CLI with [Zed](https://zed.dev/), add the following configuration to your `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_servers\": {\n    \"Kimi CLI\": {\n      \"command\": \"kimi\",\n      \"args\": [\"--acp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can create Kimi CLI threads in Zed's agent panel.\n\n### Using MCP tools\n\nKimi CLI supports the well-established MCP config convention. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.context7.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun `kimi` with `--mcp-config-file` option to connect to the specified MCP servers:\n\n```sh\nkimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json\n```\n\n## Development\n\nTo develop Kimi CLI, run:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli.git\ncd kimi-cli\n\nmake prepare  # prepare the development environment\n```\n\nThen you can start working on Kimi CLI.\n\nRefer to the following commands after you make changes:\n\n```sh\nuv run kimi  # run Kimi CLI\n\nmake format  # format code\nmake check  # run linting and type checking\nmake test  # run tests\nmake help  # show all make targets\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Kimi CLI! Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

      "readme": "# 🍌 Pico-Banana-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Text-Guided Image Editing\n\n<font size=7><div align='center' > [[📖 Paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808)]  </div></font>\n\n**Pico-Banana-400K** is a large-scale dataset of **~400K text–image–edit triplets** designed to advance research in **text-guided image editing**.  \nEach example contains:\n- an **original image** (from [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html)),  \n- a **human-like edit instruction**, and  \n- the **edited result** generated by Nano-Banana and verified by Gemini-2.5-Pro.\n\nThe dataset spans **35 edit operations** across **8 semantic categories**, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 🧩 Key Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Total Samples** | ~257K single-turn text–image–edit triplets for SFT, ~56K single-turn text-image(positive) - image(negative)-edit for preference learning, and ~72K multi-turn texts-images-edits for multi-turn applications|\n| **Source** | [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html) |\n| **Edit Operations** | 35 across 8 semantic categories |\n| **Categories** | Pixel & Photometric, Object-Level, Scene Composition, Stylistic, Text & Symbol, Human-Centric, Scale & Perspective, Spatial/Layout |\n| **Image Resolution** | 512–1024 px |\n| **Prompt Generator** | [Gemini-2.5-Flash](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/) |\n| **Editing Model** | Nano-Banana |\n| **Self-Evaluation** | Automated judging pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Pro for edit quality |\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Dataset Construction\n\nPico-Banana-400K is built using a **two-stage multimodal generation pipeline**:\n\n1. **Instruction Generation**  \n   Each Open Images sample is passed to *Gemini-2.5-Flash*, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B. \n   Example:  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"instruction\": \"Change the red car to blue.\"\n   }\n   \n\n2. **Editing + Self-Evaluation**\n   The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures:\n   Instruction Compliance (40%)\n   Editing Realism (25%)\n   Preservation Balance (20%)\n   Technical Quality (15%)\n   Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.\n\n## 📊 Dataset Statistics\n\n**Nano-Banana-400K** contains **~400K image editing data**, covering a wide visual and semantic range drawn from real-world imagery.\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Category Distribution\n\n| Category | Description | Percentage |\n|:----------|:-------------|:------------:|\n| **Object-Level Semantic** | Add, remove, replace, or relocate objects | **35%** |\n| **Scene Composition & Multi-Subject** | Contextual and environmental transformations | **20%** |\n| **Human-Centric** | Edits involving clothing, expression, or appearance | **18%** |\n| **Stylistic** | Domain and artistic style transfer | **10%** |\n| **Text & Symbol** | Edits involving visible text, signs, or symbols | **8%** |\n| **Pixel & Photometric** | Brightness, contrast, and tonal adjustments | **5%** |\n| **Scale & Perspective** | Zoom, viewpoint, or framing changes | **2%** |\n| **Spatial / Layout** | Outpainting, composition, or canvas extension | **2%** |\n\n---\n\n### 📂 Data Composition\n\n- **Single-Turn SFT samples (successful edits):** ~257K  \n- **Single-Turn Preference samples (failure cases):** ~56K\n- **Multi-Turn SFT samples (successful cases):** ~72K  \n- **Gemini-generated instructions:** concise, natural, and image-aware\n- **Edit coverage:** 35 edit types across 8 semantic categories  \n- **Image diversity:** includes humans, objects, text-rich scenes, etc from Open Images  \n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ Visualization\n\nBelow are representative examples from different categories:\n\n| Category | Example |\n|:----------|:---------|\n| Object-Level | “Replace the red apple with a green one.” |\n| Scene Composition | “Add sunlight streaming through the window.” |\n| Human-Centric | “Change the person’s expression to smiling.” |\n| Text & Symbol | “Uppercase the text on the billboard.” |\n| Stylistic | “Convert the image to a Van Gogh painting style.” |\n\n---\n\nPico-Banana-400K provides both **breadth** (diverse edit operations) and **depth** (quality-controlled multimodal supervision), making it a strong foundation for training and evaluating text-guided image editing models.\n\n## 🧠 Applications\n\n**Pico-Banana-400K** serves as a versatile resource for advancing controllable and instruction-aware image editing.  \nBeyond single-step editing, the dataset enables **multi-turn, conversational editing** and **reward-based training paradigms**.\n\n\n\n## 📦 Dataset Download Guide\n\nThe **Pico-Banana-400K** dataset is hosted on Apple’s public CDN.  \nYou ",

It particularly excels in efficient and high-quality long video generation, representing our first step toward world models.\n\n### Key Features\n- 🌟 **Unified architecture for multiple tasks**: LongCat-Video unifies *Text-to-Video*, *Image-to-Video*, and *Video-Continuation* tasks within a single video generation framework. It natively supports all these tasks with a single model and consistently delivers strong performance across each individual task.\n- 🌟 **Long video generation**: LongCat-Video is natively pretrained on *Video-Continuation* tasks, enabling it to produce minutes-long videos without color drifting or quality degradation.\n- 🌟 **Efficient inference**: LongCat-Video generates $720p$, $30fps$ videos within minutes by employing a coarse-to-fine generation strategy along both the temporal and spatial axes. Block Sparse Attention further enhances efficiency, particularly at high resolutions\n- 🌟 **Strong performance with multi-reward RLHF**: Powered by multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), comprehensive evaluations on both internal and public benchmarks demonstrate that LongCat-Video achieves performance comparable to leading open-source video generation models as well as the latest commercial solutions.\n\nFor more detail, please refer to the comprehensive [***LongCat-Video Technical Report***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22200).\n\n## 🎥 Teaser Video\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00fa63f0-9c4e-461a-a79e-c662ad596d7d\" width=\"2264\" height=\"384\"> </video>\n</div>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\nClone the repo:\n\n```shell\ngit clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video\ncd LongCat-Video\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n# create conda environment\nconda create -n longcat-video python=3.10\nconda activate longcat-video\n\n# install torch (configure according to your CUDA version)\npip install torch==2.6.0+cu124 torchvision==0.21.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124\n\n# install flash-attn-2\npip install ninja \npip install psutil \npip install packaging \npip install flash_attn==2.7.4.post1\n\n# install other requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFlashAttention-2 is enabled in the model config by default; you can also change the model config (\"./weights/LongCat-Video/dit/config.json\") to use FlashAttention-3 or xformers once installed.\n\n### Model Download\n\n| Models | Download Link |\n| --- | --- |\n| LongCat-Video | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video) |\n\nDownload models using huggingface-cli:\n```shell\npip install \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\nhuggingface-cli download meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video --local-dir ./weights/LongCat-Video\n```\n\n### Run Text-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_text_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_text_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Image-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_image_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_image_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Video-Continuation\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_video_continuation.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_video_continuation.py --context_parallel_size=2 -",

Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving **efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance**. To this end, we propose **FlashVSR**, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. **FlashVSR runs at ∼17 FPS for 768 × 1408 videos on a single A100 GPU** by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train–test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct **VSR-120K**, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves **state-of-the-art performance with up to ∼12× speedup** over prior one-step diffusion VSR models.\n\n---\n\n### 📰 News\n\n- **Nov 2025 — 🎉 [FlashVSR v1.1](https://huggingface.co/JunhaoZhuang/FlashVSR-v1.1) released:** enhanced stability + fidelity  \n- **Oct 2025 — [FlashVSR v1](https://huggingface.co/JunhaoZhuang/FlashVSR)  (initial release)**: Inference code and model weights are available now! 🎉  \n- **Bug Fix (October 21, 2025):** Fixed `local_attention_mask` update logic to prevent artifacts when switching between different aspect ratios during continuous inference.  \n- **Coming Soon:** Dataset release (**VSR-120K**) for large-scale training.\n\n---\n\n### 📢 Important Quality Note (ComfyUI & other third-party implementations)\n\nFirst of all, huge thanks to the community for the fast adoption, feedback, and contributions to FlashVSR! 🙌  \nDuring community testing, we noticed that some third-party implementations of FlashVSR (e.g. early ComfyUI versions) do **not include our Locality-Constrained Sparse Attention (LCSA)** module and instead fall back to **dense attention**. This may lead to **noticeable quality degradation**, especially at higher resolutions.  \nCommunity discussion: https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-WanVideoWrapper/issues/1441\n\nBelow is a comparison example provided by a community member:\n\n| Fig.1 – LR Input Video | Fig.2 – 3rd-party (no LCSA) | Fig.3 – Official FlashVSR |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea12a191-48d5-47c0-a8e5-e19ad13581a9\" controls width=\"260\"></video> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8e53bd5-7eca-420d-9cc6-2b9c06831047\" controls width=\"260\"></video> | <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d80618-d13d-4346-8e37-38d2fabf9827\" controls width=\"260\"></video> |\n\n✅ The **official FlashVSR pipeline (this repository)**:\n- **Better preserves fine structures and details**\n- **Effectively avoids texture aliasing and visual artifacts**\n\nWe are also working on a **version that does not rely on the Block-Sparse Attention library** while keeping **the same output quality**; this alternative may run slower than the optimized original implementation.\n\nThanks again to the community for actively testing and helping improve FlashVSR together! 🚀\n\n---\n\n### 📋 TODO\n\n- ✅ Release inference code and model weights  \n- ⬜ Release dataset (VSR-120K)\n\n---\n\n### 🚀 Getting Started\n\nFollow these steps to set up and run **FlashVSR** on your local machine:\n\n> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is primarily designed and optimized for **4× video super-resolution**.  \n> We **strongly recommend** using the **4× SR setting** to achieve better results and stability. ✅\n\n#### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenImaging",
