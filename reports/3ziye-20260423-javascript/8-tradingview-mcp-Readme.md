# TradingView MCP Bridge

Personal AI assistant for your TradingView Desktop charts. Connects Claude Code to your locally running TradingView app via Chrome DevTools Protocol for AI-assisted chart analysis, Pine Script development, and workflow automation.

> [!WARNING]
> **This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with TradingView Inc.** It interacts with your locally running TradingView Desktop application via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Review the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires a valid TradingView subscription.** This tool does not bypass or circumvent any TradingView paywall or access control. It reads from and controls the TradingView Desktop app already running on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> **All data processing occurs locally on your machine.** No TradingView data is transmitted, stored, or redistributed externally by this tool.

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool accesses undocumented internal TradingView APIs via the Electron debug interface. These can change or break without notice in any TradingView update. Pin your TradingView Desktop version if stability matters to you.

## How It Works (and why it's safe to run)

This tool does not connect to TradingView's servers, modify any TradingView files, or intercept any network traffic. It communicates exclusively with your locally running TradingView Desktop instance via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) — a standard debugging interface built into all Chromium/Electron applications by Google, including VS Code, Slack, and Discord.

The debug port is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by you using a standard Chromium flag (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`). Nothing happens without that deliberate step.

## What This Tool Does Not Do

- Connect to TradingView's servers or APIs
- Store, transmit, or redistribute any market data
- Work without a valid TradingView subscription and installed Desktop app
- Bypass any TradingView paywall or access restriction
- Execute real trades (chart interaction only)
- Work if TradingView changes their internal Electron structure

## Research Context

This project explores an open research question: **how can LLM-based agents interact with professional trading interfaces to support human decision-making?**

Specifically it investigates:

- How structured tool APIs (MCP) can bridge LLMs and stateful desktop financial applications
- What latency, context, and reliability constraints emerge when an agent operates on live chart data
- How agents handle ambiguous financial UI state (e.g. interpreting Pine Script output, reading indicator tables)
- Whether natural language is an effective interface for chart navigation and Pine Script development
- The failure modes of LLM agents operating in real-time data environments

This is not a trading bot. It is an interface layer that makes a trading application legible to an LLM agent, allowing researchers and developers to study human-AI collaboration in financial workflows.

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for open questions, findings, and related work.

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView Desktop app** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code** with MCP support (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## What It Does

Gives your AI assistant eyes and hands on your own chart:

- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read your chart's indicator values, price levels, and annotations
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal lines, rectangles, text annotations
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, and delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries/exits
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state for AI visual analysis
- **Multi-pane layouts** — set up 2x2, 3x1, etc. grids with different symbols per pane
- **Monitor your chart** — stream JSONL from your locally running chart for local monitoring scripts
- **CLI access** — every MCP tool is also a `tv` CLI command, pipe-friendly with JSON output
- **Launch TradingView** — auto-detect and launch with debug mode from any platform

## Install with Claude Code

Paste this into Claude Code and it will handle the rest:

> Install the TradingView MCP server. Clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git, run npm install, add it to my MCP config at ~/.claude/.mcp.json, and launch TradingView with the debug port. Then verify the connection with tv_health_check.

Or follow the manual steps below.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp.git
cd tradingview-mcp
npm install
```

### 2. Launch TradingView with CDP

TradingView Desktop must be running with Chrome DevTools Protocol enabled on port 9222.

**Mac:**
```bash
./scripts/launch_tv
