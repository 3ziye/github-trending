# Quick Start in Just 4 Steps.

### 1. Environment Preparation
You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
### 2. Download the Project
#### 2.1
Download from GitHub
```shell
git clone https://github.com/toolsetlink/upgradelink.git
```
Download from GitCode
```shell
git clone https://gitcode.com/toolsetlink/upgradelink.git
```

### 3. Enter the Project and Start mysql and redis in the development Directory
> Note: If you have independent mysql and redis environments, refer to the self-build documentation.

#### 3.1 Start mysql

```shell
cd upgradelink/development/mysql-8.4.3
```

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```


#### 3.2 Start redis

```shell
cd upgradelink/development/redis-6.0.20
```

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### 4. Start UpgradeLink

When executing the command for the first time, the required Docker images will be automatically downloaded. The waiting time depends on the network speed. You can also download the relevant images in advance to shorten the waiting time for deployment commands.

```shell
docker run -d --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 8081:8080 -p 8888:8888 toolsetlink/upgradelink-standalone:v2.0.6
```
