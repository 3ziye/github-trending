## What is OpenFang?

OpenFang is an **open-source Agent Operating System** — not a chatbot framework, not a Python wrapper around an LLM, not a "multi-agent orchestrator." It is a full operating system for autonomous agents, built from scratch in Rust.

Traditional agent frameworks wait for you to type something. OpenFang runs **autonomous agents that work for you** — on schedules, 24/7, building knowledge graphs, monitoring targets, generating leads, managing your social media, and reporting results to your dashboard.

The entire system compiles to a **single ~32MB binary**. One install, one command, your agents are live.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openfang.sh/install | sh
openfang init
openfang start
# Dashboard live at http://localhost:4200
```

## Hands: Agents That Actually Do Things

<p align="center"><em>"Traditional agents wait for you to type. Hands work <strong>for</strong> you."</em></p>

**Hands** are OpenFang's core innovation — pre-built autonomous capability packages that run independently, on schedules, without you having to prompt them. This is not a chatbot. This is an agent that wakes up at 6 AM, researches your competitors, builds a knowledge graph, scores the findings, and delivers a report to your Telegram before you've had coffee.

Each Hand bundles:
- **HAND.toml** — Manifest declaring tools, settings, requirements, and dashboard metrics
- **System Prompt** — Multi-phase operational playbook (not a one-liner — these are 500+ word expert procedures)
- **SKILL.md** — Domain expertise reference injected into context at runtime
- **Guardrails** — Approval gates for sensitive actions (e.g. Browser Hand requires approval before any purchase)

All compiled into the binary. No downloading, no pip install, no Docker pull.

### The 7 Bundled Hands

| Hand | What It Actually Does |
|------|----------------------|
| **Clip** | Takes a YouTube URL, downloads it, identifies the best moments, cuts them into vertical shorts with captions and thumbnails, optionally adds AI voice-over, and publishes to Telegram and WhatsApp. 8-phase pipeline. FFmpeg + yt-dlp + 5 STT backends. |
| **Lead** | Runs daily. Discovers prospects matching your ICP, enriches them with web research, scores 0-100, deduplicates against your existing database, and delivers qualified leads in CSV/JSON/Markdown. Builds ICP profiles over time. |
| **Collector** | OSINT-grade intelligence. You give it a target (company, person, topic). It monitors continuously — change detection, sentiment tracking, knowledge graph construction, and critical alerts when something important shifts. |
| **Predictor** | Superforecasting engine. Collects signals from multiple sources, builds calibrated reasoning chains, makes predictions with confidence intervals, and tracks its own accuracy using Brier scores. Has a contrarian mode that deliberately argues against consensus. |
| **Researcher** | Deep autonomous researcher. Cross-references multiple sources, evaluates credibility using CRAAP criteria (Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy, Purpose), generates cited reports with APA formatting, supports multiple languages. |
| **Twitter** | Autonomous Twitter/X account manager. Creates content in 7 rotating formats, schedules posts for optimal engagement, responds to mentions, tracks performance metrics. Has an appro
