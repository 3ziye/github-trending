# OpenClaude

OpenClaude is an open-source coding-agent CLI for cloud and local model providers.

Use OpenAI-compatible APIs, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other supported backends while keeping one terminal-first workflow: prompts, tools, agents, MCP, slash commands, and streaming output.

## Why OpenClaude

- Use one CLI across cloud APIs and local model backends
- Save provider profiles inside the app with `/provider`
- Run with OpenAI-compatible services, Gemini, GitHub Models, Codex, Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other supported providers
- Keep coding-agent workflows in one place: bash, file tools, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and web tools
- Use the bundled VS Code extension for launch integration and theme support

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @gitlawb/openclaude
```

If the install later reports `ripgrep not found`, install ripgrep system-wide and confirm `rg --version` works in the same terminal before starting OpenClaude.

### Start

```bash
openclaude
```

Inside OpenClaude:

- run `/provider` for guided provider setup and saved profiles
- run `/onboard-github` for GitHub Models onboarding

### Fastest OpenAI setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"

openclaude
```

### Fastest local Ollama setup

macOS / Linux:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI=1
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export OPENAI_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b

openclaude
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:CLAUDE_CODE_USE_OPENAI="1"
$env:OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434/v1"
$env:OPENAI_MODEL="qwen2.5-coder:7b"

openclaude
```

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Setup Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | `/provider` or env vars | Works with OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral, LM Studio, and other compatible `/v1` servers |
| Gemini | `/provider` or env vars | Supports API key, access token, or local ADC workflow on current `main` |
| GitHub Models | `/onboard-github` | Interactive onboarding with saved credentials |
| Codex | `/provider` | Uses existing Codex credentials when available |
| Ollama | `/provider` or env vars | Local inference with no API key |
| Atomic Chat | advanced setup | Local Apple Silicon backend |
| Bedrock / Vertex / Foundry | env vars | Additional provider integrations for supported environments |

## What Works

- **Tool-driven coding workflows**: Bash, file read/write/edit, grep, glob, agents, tasks, MCP, and slash commands
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time token output and tool progress
- **Tool calling**: Multi-step tool loops with model calls, tool execution, and follow-up responses
- **Images**: URL and base64 image inputs for providers that support vision
- **Provider profiles**: Guided setup plus saved `.openclaude-profile.json` support
- **Local and remote model backends**: Cloud APIs, local servers, and Apple Silicon local inference

## Provider Notes

OpenClaude supports multiple providers, but behavior is not identical across all of them.

- Anthropic-specific features may not exist on other providers
- Tool quality depends heavily on the selected model
- Smaller local models can struggle with long multi-step tool flows
- Some providers impose lower output caps than the CLI defaults, and OpenClaude adapts where possible

For best results, use models with strong tool/function calling support.

## Agent Routing

OpenClaude can route different agents to different models through settings-based routing. This is useful for cost optimization or splitting work by model strength.

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agentMode
