🦐 PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight personal AI Assistant inspired by [nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), refactored from the ground up in Go through a self-bootstrapping process, where the AI agent itself drove the entire architectural migration and code optimization.

⚡️ Runs on $10 hardware with <10MB RAM: That's 99% less memory than OpenClaw and 98% cheaper than a Mac mini!
