In just 8 months, Manus went from launch to $100M+ revenue. Their secret? **Context engineering**.\n\n> \"Markdown is my 'working memory' on disk. Since I process information iteratively and my active context has limits, Markdown files serve as scratch pads for notes, checkpoints for progress, building blocks for final deliverables.\"\n> — Manus AI\n\n## The Problem\n\nClaude Code (and most AI agents) suffer from:\n\n- **Volatile memory** — TodoWrite tool disappears on context reset\n- **Goal drift** — After 50+ tool calls, original goals get forgotten\n- **Hidden errors** — Failures aren't tracked, so the same mistakes repeat\n- **Context stuffing** — Everything crammed into context instead of stored\n\n## The Solution: 3-File Pattern\n\nFor every complex task, create THREE files:\n\n```\ntask_plan.md      → Track phases and progress\nfindings.md       → Store research and findings\nprogress.md       → Session log and test results\n```\n\n### The Core Principle\n\n```\nContext Window = RAM (volatile, limited)\nFilesystem",

      "readme": "# Agent Skills for Context Engineering\n\nA comprehensive, open collection of Agent Skills focused on context engineering principles for building production-grade AI agent systems. These skills teach the art and science of curating context to maximize agent effectiveness across any agent platform.\n\n## What is Context Engineering?\n\nContext engineering is the discipline of managing the language model's context window. Unlike prompt engineering, which focuses on crafting effective instructions, context engineering addresses the holistic curation of all information that enters the model's limited attention budget: system prompts, tool definitions, retrieved documents, message history, and tool outputs.\n\nThe fundamental challenge is that context windows are constrained not by raw token capacity but by attention mechanics. As context length increases, models exhibit predictable degradation patterns: the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon, U-shaped attention curves, and attention scarcity. Effective context engineering means finding the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes.\n\n## Skills Overview\n\n### Foundational Skills\n\nThese skills establish the foundational understanding required for all subsequent context engineering work.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [context-fundamentals](skills/context-fundamentals/) | Understand what context is, why it matters, and the anatomy of context in agent systems |\n| [context-degradation](skills/context-degradation/) | Recognize patterns of context failure: lost-in-middle, poisoning, distraction, and clash |\n| [context-compression](skills/context-compression/) | Design and evaluate compression strategies for long-running sessions |\n\n### Architectural Skills\n\nThese skills cover the patterns and structures for building effective agent systems.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [multi-agent-patterns](skills/multi-agent-patterns/) | Master orchestrator, peer-to-peer, and hierarchical multi-agent architectures |\n| [memory-systems](skills/memory-systems/) | Design short-term, long-term, and graph-based memory architectures |\n| [tool-design](skills/tool-design/) | Build tools that agents can use effectively |\n| [filesystem-context](skills/filesystem-context/) | Use filesystems for dynamic context discovery, tool output offloading, and plan persistence |\n| [hosted-agents](skills/hosted-agents/) | **NEW** Build background coding agents with sandboxed VMs, pre-built images, multiplayer support, and multi-client interfaces |\n\n### Operational Skills\n\nThese skills address the ongoing operation and optimization of agent systems.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [context-optimization](skills/context-optimization/) | Apply compaction, masking, and caching strategies |\n| [evaluation](skills/evaluation/) | Build evaluation frameworks for agent systems |\n| [advanced-evaluation](skills/advanced-evaluation/) | Master LLM-as-a-Judge techniques: direct scoring, pairwise comparison, rubric generation, and bias mitigation |\n\n### Development Methodology\n\nThese skills cover the meta-level practices for building LLM-powered projects.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [project-development](skills/project-development/) | Design and build LLM projects from ideation through deployment, including task-model fit analysis, pipeline architecture, and structured output design |\n\n### Cognitive Architecture Skills\n\nThese skills cover formal cognitive modeling for rational agent systems.\n\n| Skill | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [bdi-mental-states](skills/bdi-mental-states/) | **NEW** Transform external RDF context into agent mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions) using formal BDI ontology patterns for deliberative reasoning and explainability |\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\n### Progressive Disclosure\n\nEach skill is structured for efficient context use. At startup, agents load only skill names and descriptions. Full content loads only when a skill is activated for relevant tasks.\n\n### Platform Agnosticism\n\nThese skills focus on transferable principles rather than vendor-specific implementations. The patterns work across Claude Code, Cursor, and any agent platform that supports skills or allows custom instructions.\n\n### Conceptual Foundation with Practical Examples\n\nScripts and examples demonstrate concepts using Python pseudocode that works across environments without requiring specific dependency installations.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Usage with Claude Code\n\nThis repository is a **Claude Code Plugin Marketplace** containing context engineering skills that Claude automatically discovers and activates based on your task context.\n\n### Installation\n\n**Step 1: Add the Marketplace**\n\nRun this command in Claude Code to register this repository as a plugin source:\n\n```\n/plugin marketplace add muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering\n```\n\n**Step 2: Browse and Install**\n\nOption A - Browse available ",

Why \"Compounding\"?\n\nThe name is a pun. **Continuous** because Claude maintains state across sessions. **Compounding** because each session makes the system smarter—learnings accumulate like compound interest.\n\n---\n\n## Design Principles\n\nAn agent is five things: **Prompt + Tools + Context + Memory + Model**.\n\n| Component | What We Optimize |\n|-----------|------------------|\n| **Prompt** | Skills inject relevant context; hooks add system reminders |\n| **Tools** | TLDR reduces tokens; agents parallelize work |\n| **Context** | Not just *what* Claude knows, but *how* it's provided |\n| **Memory** | Daemon extracts learnings; recall surfaces them |\n| **Model** | Becomes swappable when the other four are solid |\n\n### Anti-Complexity\n\nWe resist plugin sprawl. Every MCP, subscription, and tool you add promises improvement but risks breaking context, tools, or prompts through clashes.\n\n**Our approach:**\n- **Time, not money** — No required paid services. Perplexity and NIA are optional, high-value-per-token.\n- **Learn, don't accumulate** — A system that learns handles edge cases better than one that collects plugins.\n- **Shift-left validation** — Hooks run pyright/ruff after edits, catching errors before tests.\n\nThe failure modes of complex systems are structurally invisible until they happen. A learning, context-efficient system doesn't prevent all failures—but it recovers and improves.\n\n---\n\n## How to Talk to Claude\n\n**You don't need to memorize slash commands.** Just describe what you want naturally.\n\n### The Skill Activation System\n\nWhen you send a message, a hook injects context that tells **Claude** which skills and agents are relevant. Claude infers from a rule-based system and decides which tools to use.\n\n```\n> \"Fix the login bug in auth.py\"\n\n🎯 SKILL ACTIVATION CHECK\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n⚠️ CRITICAL SKILLS (REQUIRED):\n  → create_handoff\n\n📚 RECOMMENDED SKILLS:\n  → fix\n  → debug\n\n🤖 RECOMMENDED AGENTS (token-efficient):\n  → debug-agent\n  → scout\n\nACTION: Use Skill tool BEFORE responding\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n```\n\n### Priority Levels\n\n| Level | Meaning |\n|-------|---------|\n| ⚠️ **CRITICAL** | Must use (e.g., handoffs before ending session) |\n| 📚 **RECOMMENDED** | Should use (e.g., workflow skills) |\n| 💡 **SUGGESTED** | Consider using (e.g., optimization tools) |\n| 📌 **OPTIONAL** | Nice to have (e.g., documentation helpers) |\n\n### Natural Language Examples\n\n| What You Say | What Activates |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| \"Fix the broken login\" | `/fix` workflow → debug-agent, scout |\n| \"Build a user dashboard\" | `/build` workflow → plan-agent, kraken |\n| \"I want to understand this codebase\" | `/explore` + scout agent |\n| \"What could go wrong with this plan?\" | `/premort",

Introduction\n\nThis repository contains the official implementation for the paper: **[Conditional Memory via Scalable Lookup: A New Axis of Sparsity for Large Language Models](Engram_paper.pdf)**.\n\n> **Abstract:** While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) scales capacity via conditional computation, Transformers lack a native primitive for knowledge lookup. To address this, we explore **conditional memory** as a complementary sparsity axis, instantiated via **Engram**, a module that modernizes classic $N$-gram embeddings for $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ lookup.\n\n**Key Contributions:**\n- **Sparsity Allocation:** We formulate the trade-off between neural computation (MoE) and static memory (Engram), identifying a U-shaped scaling law that guides optimal capacity allocation.\n- **Empirical Verification:** Under strict iso-parameter and iso-FLOPs constraints, the Engram-27B model demonstrates consistent improvements over MoE baselines across knowledge, reasoning, code and math domains.\n- **Mechanistic Analysis:** Our analysis suggests that Engram relieves early layers from static pattern reconstruction, potentially preserving effective depth for complex reasoning.\n- **System Efficiency:** The module employs deterministic addressing, enabling the offloading of massive embedding tables to host memory with minimal inference overhead.\n\n\n## 2. Architecture\n\nThe Engram module augments the backbone by retrieving static $N$-gram memory and fusing it with dynamic hidden states. The architecture is shown below ([drawio provided](drawio/Engram.drawio)):\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"75%\" src=\"figures/arch.png\" alt=\"Engram Architecture\">\n</p>\n\n## 3.

Case Study of Engram\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"figures/case.png\" alt=\"Long Context Results\">\n</p>\n\n## 5. Quick Start\n\nWe recommend using Python 3.8+ and PyTorch.\n```bash\npip install torch numpy transformers sympy\n```\nWe provide a standalone implementation to demonstrate the core logic of the Engram module:\n```bash\npython engram_demo_v1.py\n```\n\n> ⚠️ **Note:** The provided code is a demonstration version intended to illustrate the data flow. It mocks standard components (like Attention/MoE/mHC) to focus on the Engram module. \n\n\n## 6. License\nThe use of Engram models is subject to [the Model License](LICENSE).\n\n## 7.

It\nenables platforms (like AI agents and apps), businesses, Payment Service\nProviders (PSPs), and Credential Providers (CPs) to communicate effectively,\nensuring secure and consistent commerce experiences across the web.\n\nWith UCP, businesses can:\n\n*   **Declare** supported capabilities to enable autonomous discovery by\n    platforms.\n*   **Facilitate** secure checkout sessions, with or without human intervention.\n*   **Offer** personalized shopping experiences through standardized data\n    exchange.\n\n## Why UCP?\n\nAs commerce becomes increasingly agentic and distributed, the ability for\ndifferent systems to interoperate without custom, one-off integrations is vital.\nUCP aims to:\n\n*   **Standardize Interaction:** Provide a uniform way for platforms to interact\n    with businesses, regardless of the underlying backend.\n*   **Modularize Commerce:** Breakdown commerce into distinct **Capabilities**\n    (e.g., Checkout, Order) and **Extensions** (e.g., Discounts,\n    Fulfillment), allowing for flexible implementation.\n*   **Enable Agentic Commerce:** Designed from the ground up to support AI\n    agents acting on behalf of users to discover products, fill carts, and\n    complete purchases securely.\n*   **Enhance Security:** Support for advanced security patterns like AP2\n    mandates and verifiable credentials.\n\n### Key Features\n\n*   **Composable Architecture:** UCP defines **Capabilities** (such as\n    \"Checkout\" or \"Identity Linking\") that businesses implement to enable easy\n    integration. On top of that, specific **Extensions** can be added to enhance\n    the consumer experience without bloating the capability definitions.\n*   **Dynamic Discovery:** Businesses declare their supported Capabilities in a\n    standardized profile, allowing platforms to autonomously discover and\n    configure themselves.\n*   **Transport Agnostic:** The protocol is designed to work across various\n    transports. Businesses can offer Capabilities via REST APIs, MCP (Model\n    Context Protocol), or A2A, depending on their infrastructure.\n*   **Built on Standards:** UCP leverages existing open standards for payments,\n    identity, and security wherever applicable, rather than reinventing the\n    wheel.\n*   **Developer Friendly:** A comprehensive set of SDKs and libraries\n    facilitates rapid development and integration.\n\n## Key Capabilities\n\nThe initial release focuses on the essential primitives for transacting:\n\n*   **Checkout:** Facilitates checkout sessions including cart management and\n    tax calculation, supporting flows with or without human intervention.\n*   **Identity Linking:** Enables platforms to obtain authorization to perform\n    actions on a user's behalf via OAuth 2.0.\n*   **Order:** Webhook-based updates for order lifecycle events (shipped,\n    delivered, returned).\n*   **Payment Token Exchange:** Protocols for PSPs and Credential Providers to\n    securely exchange payment tokens and credentials.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n*   📚 **Explore the Documentation:** Visit [ucp.dev](https://ucp.dev) for a\n    complete overview, the full protocol specification, tutorials, and guides.\n*   🎬 **Review our\n    [samples](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/samples)** for\n    implementation examples.\n*   🛠️ **Use our\n    [SDKs](https://github.com/orgs/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/repositories)**\n    to start building your own integrations.\n*   📝 **Check conformance** with our [conformance tests](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/conformance).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome community contributions to enhance and evolve UCP.\n\n*   **Questions & Discussions:** Join our [GitHub\n    Discussions](https://github.com/Universal-Commerce-Protocol/ucp/discussions).\n*   **Issues & Feedback:** Report issues or sugges",

Please give it a try via our [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0) and our [Official Site](https://hunyuan.tencent.com/motion)!\n\n\n## **Introduction**\n\n**HY-Motion 1.0** is a series of text-to-3D human motion generation models based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) and Flow Matching. It allows developers to generate skeleton-based 3D character animations from simple text prompts, which can be directly integrated into various 3D animation pipelines. This model series is the first to scale DiT-based text-to-motion models to the billion-parameter level, achieving significant improvements in instruction-following capabilities and motion quality over existing open-source models.\n\n### Key Features\n- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in both instruction-following capability and generated motion quality.\n\n- **Billion-Scale Models**: We are the first to successfully scale DiT-based models to the billion-parameter level for text-to-motion generation. This results in superior instruction understanding and following capabilities, outperforming comparable open-source models.\n\n- **Advanced Three-Stage Training**: Our models are trained using a comprehensive three-stage process:\n\n    - *Large-Scale Pre-training*: Trained on over 3,000 hours of diverse motion data to learn a broad motion prior.\n\n    - *High-Quality Fine-tuning*: Fine-tuned on 400 hours of curated, high-quality 3D motion data to enhance motion detail and smoothness.\n\n    - *Reinforcement Learning*: Utilizes Reinforcement Learning from human feedback and reward models to further refine instruction-following and motion naturalness.\n\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/pipeline.png\" alt=\"System Overview\" width=\"100%\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/arch.png\" alt=\"Architecture\" width=\"100%\">\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/sotacomp.jpg\" alt=\"ComparisonSoTA\" width=\"100%\">\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n## 🎁 Model Zoo\n\n**HY-Motion 1.0 Series**\n\n| Model | Description | Date | Size | Huggingface | VRAM (min) |\n|:-------|:-------------|:------:|:------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|\n| **HY-Motion-1.0** | Standard Text2Motion Model | 2025-12-30 | 1.0B | [Download](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0/tree/main/HY-Motion-1.0) | 26GB |\n| **HY-Motion-1.0-Lite** | Lightweight Text2Motion Model | 2025-12-30 | 0.46B | [Download](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HY-Motion-1.0/tree/main/HY-Motion-1.0-Lite) | 24GB |\n\n*Note*: To reduce GPU VRAM requirements, please use the following settings: `--num_seeds=1`, text prompt with less than 30 words, and motion length less than 5 seconds.  \n*Note*: This table does not includes GPU VRAM requirements for LLM-based prompt engineering feature. If you have sufficient VRAM to run HY-Motion-1.0 model but gradio fails with a VRAM-related error, Run the Gradio application with prompt engineering disabled by setting the environment variable like this: `DISABLE_PROMPT_ENGINEERING=True python3 gradio_app.py`\n\n## 🤗 Get Started with HY-Motion 1.0\n\nHY-Motion 1.0 supports macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n\n- [Code Usage (CLI)](#code-usage-cli)\n- [Gradio App](#gradio-app)\n\n\n#### 1. Installation\n\nFirst, install PyTorch via the [official site](https://pytorch.org/).

We recommend using\n`uv` as it installs any dependencies on the fly in an isolated environment (uv installation instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer)).\nYou can also use `pip install pocket-tts` to install it manually.\n\nThis will generate a wav file `./tts_output.wav` saying the default text with the default voice, and display some speed statistics.\n```bash\nuvx pocket-tts generate\n# or if you installed it manually with pip:\npocket-tts generate\n```\nModify the voice with `--voice` and the text with `--text`. We provide a small catalog of voices.\n\nYou can take a look at [this page](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices) which details the licenses\nfor each voice.\n\n* [alba](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/alba-mackenna/casual.wav)\n* [marius](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/voice-donations/Selfie.wav)\n* [javert](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/voice-donations/Butter.wav)\n* [jean](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/ears/p010/freeform_speech_01.wav)\n* [fantine](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/vctk/p244_023.wav)\n* [cosette](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/expresso/ex04-ex02_confused_001_channel1_499s.wav)\n* [eponine](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/vctk/p262_023.wav)\n* [azelma](https://huggingface.co/kyutai/tts-voices/blob/main/vctk/p303_023.wav)\n\nThe `--voice` argument can also take a plain wav file as input for voice cloning.\nFeel free to check out the [generate documentation](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/tree/main/docs/generate.md) for more details and examples.\nFor trying multiple voices and prompts quickly, prefer using the `serve` command.\n\n### The `serve` command\n\nYou can also run a local server to generate audio via HTTP requests.\n```bash\nuvx pocket-tts serve\n# or if you installed it manually with pip:\npocket-tts serve\n```\nNavigate to `http://localhost:8000` to try the web interface, it's faster than the command line as the model is kept in memory between requests.\n\nYou can check out the [serve documentation](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/tree/main/docs/serve.md) for more details and examples.\n\n## Using it as a Python library\n\nInstall the package with\n```bash\npip install pocket-tts\n# or\nuv add pocket-tts\n```\n\nYou can use this package as a simple Python library to generate audio from text.\n```python\nfrom pocket_tts import TTSModel\nimport scipy.io.wavfile\n\ntts_model = TTSModel.load_model()\nvoice_state = tts_model.get_state_for_audio_prompt(\n    \"hf://kyutai/tts-voices/alba-mackenna/casual.wav\"\n)\naudio = tts_model.generate_audio(voice_state, \"Hello world, this is a test.\")\n# Audio is a 1D torch tensor containing PCM data.\nscipy.io.wavfile.write(\"output.wav\", tts_model.sample_rate, audio.numpy())\n```\n\nYou can have multiple voice states around if \nyou have multiple voices you want to use. `load_model()` \nand `get_state_for_audio_prompt()` are relatively slow operations,\nso we recommend to keep the model and voice states in memory if you can.\n\nYou can check out the [Python API documentation](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/tree/main/docs/python-api.md) for more details and examples.\n\n## Unsupported features\n\nAt the moment, we do not support (but would love pull requests adding):\n- [Running the TTS inside a web browser (WebAssembly)](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts/issues/1)\n- [A ",

RLMs replace the canonical `llm.completion(prompt, model)` call with a `rlm.completion(prompt, model)` call. RLMs offload the context as a variable in a REPL environment that the LM can interact with and launch sub-LM calls inside of.\n\nThis repository provides an extensible inference engine for using RLMs around standard API-based and local LLMs. The initial experiments and idea were proposed in a [blogpost](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/) in 2025, with expanded results in an [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This repository contains inference code for RLMs with support for various sandbox environments. Open-source contributions are welcome. This repository is maintained by the authors of the paper from the MIT OASYS lab.\n\n<!-- ## Installation\n```\npip install rlm\n```\nTo install the latest from `main`:\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/alexzhang13/rlm.git\n```\n``` -->\n\n## Quick Setup\nSet up the dependencies with `uv` (or your virtual environment of choice):\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nuv init && uv venv --python 3.12  # change version as needed\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\nThis project includes a `Makefile` to simplify common tasks.\n\n- `make install`: Install base dependencies.\n- `make check`: Run linter, formatter, and tests.\n\nTo run a quick test, the following will run an RLM query with the OpenAI client using your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` (feel free to change this). This will generate console output as well as a log which you can use with the visualizer to explore the trajectories.\n```bash\nmake quickstart\n```\n\nThe default RLM client uses a REPL environment that runs on the host process through Python `exec` calls. It uses the same virtual environment as the host process (i.e. it will have access to the same dependencies), but with some limitations in its available global modules. As an example, we can call RLM completions using GPT-5-nano:\n```python\nfrom rlm import RLM\n\nrlm = RLM(\n    backend=\"openai\",\n    backend_kwargs={\"model_name\": \"gpt-5-nano\"},\n    verbose=True,  # For printing to console with rich, disabled by default.\n)\n\nprint(rlm.completion(\"Print me the first 100 powers of two, each on a newline.\").response)\n```\n\n## REPL Environments\nWe support two types of REPL environments -- isolated, and non-isolated. Non-isolated environments (default) run code execution on the same machine as the RLM (e.g. through `exec`), which is pretty reasonable for some local low-risk tasks, like simple benchmarking, but can be problematic if the prompts or tool calls can interact with malicious users. Fully isolated environments used Cloud-based sandboxes (e.g. Prime Sandboxes, [Modal Sandboxes](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandboxes)) to run code generated by the RLM, ensuring completely isolation from the host process. Environments can be added, but we natively support the following: `local` (default), `modal`, `prime`.\n\n```python\nrlm = RLM(\n    environment=\"...\", # \"local\", \"docker\", \"modal\", \"prime\"\n    environment_kwargs={...},\n)\n```\n\n### Local Environments\nThe default `local` environment `LocalREPL` runs in the same process as the RLM itself, with specified global and local namespaces for minimal security. Using this REPL is generally safe, but should not be used for production settings. It also shares the same virtual environment (e.g. Conda or uv) as the host process.\n\n#### Docker <img src=\"https://github.com/docker.png\" alt=\"Docker\" height=\"20\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"/> (*requires [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/)*)\nWe also support a Docker-based environment called `DockerREPL` that launches the REPL environment as a Docker image. By default, we use ",
