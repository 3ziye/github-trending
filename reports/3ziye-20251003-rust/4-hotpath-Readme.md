# hotpath - find and profile bottlenecks in Rust

[![Profiling report for mevlog-rs](hotpath-report3.png)](https://github.com/pawurb/mevlog-rs)

A lightweight, easy-to-configure Rust profiler that shows exactly where your code spends time and allocates memory. Instrument any function or code block to quickly spot bottlenecks, and focus your optimizations where they matter most.

## Features

- **Zero-cost when disabled** — fully gated by a feature flag.
- **Low-overhead** profiling for both sync and async code.
- **Memory allocation tracking** — track bytes allocated or allocation counts per function.
- **Detailed stats**: avg, total time, call count, % of total runtime, and configurable percentiles (p95, p99, etc.).
- **Background processing** for minimal profiling impact.

## Quick Start

> **⚠️ Note**  
> This README reflects the latest development on the `main` branch.
> For documentation matching the current release, see [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hotpath) — it stays in sync with the published crate.

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hotpath = { version = "0.2", optional = true }

[features]
hotpath = ["dep:hotpath", "hotpath/hotpath"]
hotpath-alloc-bytes-total = ["hotpath/hotpath-alloc-bytes-total"]
hotpath-alloc-bytes-max = ["hotpath/hotpath-alloc-bytes-max"]
hotpath-alloc-count-total= ["hotpath/hotpath-alloc-count-total"]
hotpath-alloc-count-max= ["hotpath/hotpath-alloc-count-max"]
hotpath-off = ["hotpath/hotpath-off"]
```

This config ensures that the lib has **zero** overhead unless explicitly enabled via a `hotpath` feature.

Profiling features are mutually exclusive. To ensure compatibility with `--all-features` setting, the crate defines an additional `hotpath-off` flag. This is handled automatically - you should never need to enable it manually.

## Usage

```rust
use std::time::Duration;

#[cfg_attr(feature = "hotpath", hotpath::measure)]
fn sync_function(sleep: u64) {
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(sleep));
}

#[cfg_attr(feature = "hotpath", hotpath::measure)]
async fn async_function(sleep: u64) {
    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(sleep)).await;
}

// When using with tokio, place the #[tokio::main] first
#[tokio::main]
// You can configure any percentile between 0 and 100
#[cfg_attr(feature = "hotpath", hotpath::main(percentiles = [99]))]
async fn main() {
    for i in 0..100 {
        // Measured functions will automatically send metrics
        sync_function(i);
        async_function(i * 2).await;

        // Measure code blocks with static labels
        #[cfg(feature = "hotpath")]
        hotpath::measure_block!("custom_block", {
            std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_nanos(i * 3))
        });
    }
}
```

Run your program with a `hotpath` feature:

```
cargo run --features=hotpath
```

Output:

```
[hotpath] Performance summary from basic::main (Total time: 122.13ms):
+-----------------------+-------+---------+---------+----------+---------+

| basic::sync_function  | 100   | 16.99µs | 35.42µs | 1.70ms   | 1.39%   |
+-----------------------+-------+---------+---------+----------+---------+
```

## Allocation Tracking

In addition to time-based profiling, `hotpath` can track memory allocations. This feature uses a custom global allocator from [allocation-counter crate](https://github.com/fornwall/allocation-counter) to intercept all memory allocations and provides detailed statistics about memory usage per function.

Available alloc profiling modes:

- `hotpath-alloc-bytes-total` - Tracks total bytes allocated during each function call
- `hotpath-alloc-bytes-max` - Tracks peak memory usage during each function call
- `hotpath-alloc-count-total` - Tracks total number of allocations per function call
- `hotpath-alloc-count-max` - Tracks peak number of live allocations per function call

Run your program with a selected flag to print a similar report:

```
cargo run --features='hotpath,hotpath-alloc-bytes-max'
```

### Profiling memory allocations for async functions

To profile memory usage of `async` functions you have to use a similar config:

```rust
#[cfg(any(
    feature = "hotpath-alloc-bytes-total",
    feature = "hotpath-alloc-bytes-max",
    feature = "hotpath-alloc-count-total",
    feature = "hotpath-alloc-count-max",
))]
#
