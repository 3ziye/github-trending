# Codex Subscription Router

![Multi-subscription account menu](screenshots/account-menu.png)

Use multiple ChatGPT subscriptions from one independent macOS desktop app.

Codex Subscription Router creates a locally patched copy of the official
ChatGPT app, balances new chats across connected subscriptions, and keeps every
thread on one subscription so follow-up turns retain conversation context and
benefit from account-level caching.

The official ChatGPT installation is used only as build input and is never
modified. This repository contains source code and build tooling—not OpenAI
binaries or a prebuilt application.

## Highlights

- **Quota-aware routing.** New chats favour weekly allowance that will expire
  sooner, with a bounded boost for accounts holding banked usage resets.
- **Sticky conversations.** Once a thread is assigned, every follow-up returns
  to the same subscription unless that subscription is depleted.
- **Automatic failover.** A depleted thread continues through another account
  with quota; if the whole pool is empty, the app shows one combined alert.
- **Native account management.** The existing profile menu shows pooled usage,
  profile photos, plan names, masked emails, and device-code sign-in.
- **Account-aware settings.** Profile statistics can be viewed together or per
  subscription, while the Plugins page can switch Apps and MCP connections
  between accounts.
- **Per-account resets.** The native rate-limit sheet shows and consumes resets
  for the selected subscription.
- **Working macOS integrations.** The copied Appshots and Computer Use helper is
  independently identified and signed so it can receive its own privacy grants.

## How it works

The patched desktop still opens one app-server connection. A small Go
multiplexer fans that connection out to one official Codex child per account.
Each child has an isolated Codex home, while the multiplexer records the owner
of every thread.

```text
Codex Subscription Router.app
        │
        │ one app-server connection
        ▼
    codex-mux
    ├── Primary       → ~/.codex
    ├── Subscription 2 → isolated Codex home
    └── Subscription 3 → isolated Codex home
             │
             └── thread ID → persistent account owner
```

New-thread routing compares the quota burn rate needed before each weekly reset,
then applies a capped banked-reset boost. Short-window usage, pinned-thread
count, and stable account order break close results. Existing threads do not
migrate merely for load balancing.

## Compatibility

Codex Subscription Router currently targets:

| Component | Supported value |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | macOS on Apple silicon |
| Official ChatGPT version | `26.803.61601` |
| Official bundle build | `6396` |
| Go | 1.26 or newer |
| Node.js | 22.12 or newer |

The patcher verifies the official version, build, ASAR hash, renderer anchors,
and native binary constants before changing anything. An unknown upstream build
is rejected by default rather than being partially patched. See
[Compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) for the recorded hash and test details.

## Requirements

- The official ChatGPT app installed at `/Applications/ChatGPT.app`
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Go 1.26+
- Node.js 22.12+ and npm
- An Apple Development or Developer ID Application signing identity

A team-backed signing identity is required for reliable Appshots and Computer
Use permissions. Ad-hoc signing is intended only for diagnostics.

## Install

Run one command. It downloads or updates the source, installs the locked build
dependency, creates the independently signed app, and launches it:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-nnett/codex-subscription-router/main/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

The installer keeps its source checkout in
`~/.codex-subscription-router/source`. On an existing installation it uses the
same account state, creates a recoverable backup, and requires signing-team
continuity so macOS privacy grants remain valid. It stops with a clear message
instead of making a partial installation when a prerequisite or upstream
compatibility check fails.

> [!TIP]
> To inspect the installer before running it, open
> [`install.sh`](install.sh) or download it without piping it into a shell.

### Install via prompt

> Install Codex Subscription Router from `https://github.com/b-nnett/codex-subscription-router` on this Mac using the repository's supported one-command installer, without modifying the official ChatGPT app or deleting any existing router state. Verify the resulting app and C
