# Claude Code Project Configuration Showcase

> Most software engineers are seriously sleeping on how good LLM agents are right now, especially something like Claude Code.

Once you've got Claude Code set up, you can point it at your codebase, have it learn your conventions, pull in best practices, and refine everything until it's basically operating like a super-powered teammate. **The real unlock is building a solid set of reusable "[skills](#skills---domain-knowledge)" plus a few "[agents](#agents---specialized-assistants)" for the stuff you do all the time.**

### What This Looks Like in Practice

**Custom UI Library?** We have a [skill that explains exactly how to use it](.claude/skills/core-components/SKILL.md). Same for [how we write tests](.claude/skills/testing-patterns/SKILL.md), [how we structure GraphQL](.claude/skills/graphql-schema/SKILL.md), and basically how we want everything done in our repo. So when Claude generates code, it already matches our patterns and standards out of the box.

**Automated Quality Gates?** We use [hooks](.claude/settings.json) to auto-format code, run tests when test files change, type-check TypeScript, and even [block edits on the main branch](.claude/settings.md). Claude Code also created a bunch of ESLint automation, including custom rules and lint checks that catch issues before they hit review.

**Deep Code Review?** We have a [code review agent](.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md) that Claude runs after changes are made. It follows a detailed checklist covering TypeScript strict mode, error handling, loading states, mutation patterns, and more. When a PR goes up, we have a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/pr-claude-code-review.yml) that does a full PR review automatically.

**Scheduled Maintenance?** We've got GitHub workflow agents that run on a schedule:
- [Monthly docs sync](.github/workflows/scheduled-claude-code-docs-sync.yml) - Reads commits from the last month and makes sure docs are still aligned
- [Weekly code quality](.github/workflows/scheduled-claude-code-quality.yml) - Reviews random directories and auto-fixes issues
- [Biweekly dependency audit](.github/workflows/scheduled-claude-code-dependency-audit.yml) - Safe dependency updates with test verification

**Intelligent Skill Suggestions?** We built a [skill evaluation system](#skill-evaluation-hooks) that analyzes every prompt and automatically suggests which skills Claude should activate based on keywords, file paths, and intent patterns.

A ton of maintenance and quality work is just... automated. It runs ridiculously smoothly.

**JIRA/Linear Integration?** We connect Claude Code to our ticket system via [MCP servers](.mcp.json). Now Claude can read the ticket, understand the requirements, implement the feature, update the ticket status, and even create new tickets if it finds bugs along the way. The [`/ticket` command](.claude/commands/ticket.md) handles the entire workflow—from reading acceptance criteria to linking the PR back to the ticket.

We even use Claude Code for ticket triage. It reads the ticket, digs into the codebase, and leaves a comment with what it thinks should be done. So when an engineer picks it up, they're basically starting halfway through already.

**There is so much low-hanging fruit here that it honestly blows my mind people aren't all over it.**
