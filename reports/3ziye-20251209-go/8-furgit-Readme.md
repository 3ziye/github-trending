# Furgit

[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~runxiyu/furgit.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~runxiyu/furgit?)
[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/git.sr.ht/~runxiyu/furgit.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/git.sr.ht/~runxiyu/furgit)

Furgit is a fast Git library in pure Go
(and a little bit of optional Go Assembly).

## Project status

* Initial development
* No tagged releases
* API *will* break frequently
* Do not use in production
* Will likely follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the future

## Current features

* SHA-256 and SHA-1
* Reading loose objects
* Writing loose objects
* Reading packfiles
* General support for blobs, trees, commits, and tags

## Future features

* Multi pack indexes
* Repack
* [commit-graph](https://git-scm.com/docs/commit-graph)
* Network protocols
* And much more

## General goals

Furgit intends to be a general-purpose Git library.

For now, Furgit primarily prioritize APIs and optimizations that are
likely to be used by software development forges and other
server-side usages; in particular, Furgit follows the needs of
[Villosa](https://villosa.lindenii.org/villosa//repos/villosa/) and
to some extent [tangled](https://tangled.org/@tangled.org/core).

## Performance optimizations

* Aggressive pooling of byte buffers
* Aggressive pooling of custom zlib readers
* Minor SIMD optimizations for Adler-32
* Memory-mapping packfiles and their indexes

## Performance

See [gitbench](https://git.sr.ht/~runxiyu/gitbench) for details on methods.

All tests below were run on `linux.git` with `HEAD` at `6da43bbeb6918164`
on a `Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10210U CPU @ 1.60GHz`.

**Note:** go-git is expected to perform much better after
[storage: filesystem/mmap, Add PackScanner to handle large repos](https://github.com/go-git/go-git/pull/1776).

### Traversing all trees

* Git: 0.1 seconds
* Furgit: 9 seconds
* libgit2: 19 seconds
* go-git: 122 seconds

### Traversing the root tree only


* Furgit: 1ms
* Git: 4ms
* libgit2: 11ms
* go-git: 1800ms

## Dependencies

* The standard library
* Some things from `golang.org/x`

* It is unlikely that other dependencies will be introduced.
* In some cases, external code is introduced but maintained in-tree.

## Environment requirements

We currently do not intend to support flexible storage backends such as
[storers in go-git](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5/plumbing/storer);
a standard UNIX-like filesystem with
[syscall.Mmap](https://pkg.go.dev/syscall#Mmap) is expected.

## History and lineage

* I wrote [Lindenii Forge](https://forge.lindenii.org/forge/-/repos/server/)
* I wrote [hare-git](https://forge.lindenii.org/hare/-/repos/hare-git/)
* I wanted a faster Git library for
  [Lindenii Villosa](https://villosa.lindenii.org/villosa//repos/villosa/),
  the next generation of Lindenii Forge
* I translated hare-git and put it into `internal/common/git` in Villosa
* I extracted it out into a general-purpose library, which is what we
  have now
* I was thinking of names and I accidentally typed "git" as "fur" (i.e., left
  shifted one key on my QWERTY keyboard), so, "Furgit"
