### Core Technologies Behind FastCode

FastCode introduces a three-phase framework that transforms how LLMs understand and navigate codebases:

</p>

## 🏗️ Semantic-Structural Code Representation

### Multi-layered codebase understanding for comprehensive analysis

- **🔍 Hierarchical Code Units** — Advanced multi-level indexing spanning files, classes, functions, and documentation using AST-based parsing across 8+ programming languages

- **🔗 Hybrid Index** — Seamlessly combines semantic embeddings with keyword search (BM25) for robust and precise code retrieval

- **📊 Multi-Layer Graph Modeling** — Three interconnected relationship graphs (Call Graph, Dependency Graph, Inheritance Graph) enabling structural navigation across the entire codebase

### 🧭 Lightning-Fast Codebase Navigation

Finding the right code without opening every file - at lightning speed

- **⚡ Two-Stage Smart Search** — Like having a research assistant that first finds potentially relevant code, then ranks and organizes the best matches for your specific question.

- **📁 Safe File Browsing** — Explores your project structure securely, understanding folder organization and file patterns without compromising security.

- **🌐 Following Code Connections** — Traces how code pieces connect (up to 2 steps away), like following a trail of breadcrumbs through your codebase.

- **🎯 Code Skimming** — Instead of reading entire files, FastCode just looks at the "headlines" - function names, class definitions, and type hints. This is like reading a book's chapter titles instead of every page, saving massive amounts of processing power.

### 💰 Cost-Efficient Context Management

Getting maximum insight while minimizing costs - automatically

- **📈 Budget-Aware Decision Making** — Considers five key factors before processing: confidence level, query complexity, codebase size, resource cost, and iteration count. Like a cost-conscious financial advisor that weighs all options before making decisions.
