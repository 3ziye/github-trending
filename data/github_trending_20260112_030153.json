Built on a mature C++ architecture, it provides powerful rendering capabilities and flexible script bindings, supporting a \"write once, run anywhere\" philosophy.\n\nPreviously, _Cocos Creator_ referred to the combined engine and editor, spanning versions 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x. To embrace a purely open-source model and fully integrate AI, we are separating the engine from the editor. This is a significant and necessary evolution. Moving forward:\n\n**COCOS** will refer solely to the engine, with the major version upgrading to **COCOS 4**. The cross-platform framework and the core components of the editor will be converted to CLI tools and integrated into the engine's core functionality. This represents a major new addition to this open-source release.\n\n## Features\n\n1. **Modern Graphics**: The GFX implementation is designed to adapt to the modern graphics APIs, it uses Vulkan on Windows and Android, Metal on Mac OS and iOS, and WebGL on Web platforms.\n2. **High Performance**: The runtime engine is built with half C++ and half TypeScript, low-level infrastructure, native platform adaptation, renderer, and scene management are all written in C++ to ensure high runtime performance. We continue to move heavy lifting work to native as much as possible.\n3. **Customizable Render Pipeline**: The render pipeline is designed to be fully customizable, it has supported the builtin forward and deferred render pipeline across all platforms. Developers can customize their render pipeline following the same approach.\n4. **Extensible Surface Shader**: The material system is built on Coco's effect format which uses GLSL 300, the shader programs will be converted to a suitable runtime format automatically. The surface shader permits to fully customize the surface material while ensuring a universal lighting model.\n5. **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**: The standard effect adopts physically based rendering, along with the physically based camera and the lighting based on physical metrics, developers can easily achieve realistic and seamless rendering results across different environments.\n6. **Easy TypeScript API**: The user-level API set is provided in TypeScript, along with the powerful VSCode editor, development with Cocos Creator is incredibly efficient.\n\nBesides all these highlights, COCOS 4 also provides a built-in animation system, physics system, particle system, terrain editing support, complex UI system, instant preview, etc.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1503156/111037166-f27c7600-845d-11eb-988f-4c2c8b5c7321.png)\n\n## Development and Contribution Notice\n\nCocos Creator engine is open source and welcomes community participation, for open source engine development with Cocos Creator editor, you should fork this repository and setup [custom engine](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/advanced-topics/engine-customization.html) in the editor.\n\n### Prerequisite\n\n- Install [node.js v9.11.2 +](https://nodejs.org/)\n- Install [gulp-cli v2.3.0 +](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/getting-started)\n\n### Clone\n\nClone this repository into your local environment.\n\n### Install\n\nIn the cloned engine folder, run the following command to set the development environment:\n\n```bash\n# download & build engine dependencies\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis is all you have to do to set up the engine development environment.\n\n### Build\n\n- If running inside Cocos Creator, the engine will automatically compile and build after the editor window is opened. For more instructions on modifying the engine in Cocos Creator, please refer to [Engine Customization Workflow](https://docs.cocos.com/creator/manual/en/advanced-topics/engine-customization.html).\n- Outside the editor, you need to run the following command to build:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nPlease refer to [native readme](native/README.md) if you want to develop native applications.\n\n### Contribution\n\nYou can contribute to the Cocos Creator open-source engine in many ways, they are very much appreciated:\n\n1.

Open Source libraries used](#7-open-source-libraries-used)\n- [8. License and Contact](#8-license-and-contact)\n\n# 1. Usage\n\nIf you havent already, download the 0.8 beta from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/overwatch-beta-0-8-0-24919) and extract the files somewhere.\n* ⚠️ Make sure that you don't download any malicious executable and verify that GameClientApp.exe is signed by Blizzard. The signature will get broken after applying the patcher.\n* You can safely remove the BlizzardError directory.\n\n## Download a Release\n\n* Download a release.zip. Extract all files to the game directory.\n* Execute patcher.exe. It will ask for an input GameClientApp.exe, select the one you have downloaded and verified.\n  * The patcher will write a GameClientApp.patched.exe file into the same directory. The only thing this patched executable does is load inject.dll before running the game code itself.\n  * You only need to do this once, this patch is version-independent.\n* Rename prometheus.dll into inject.dll\n* Congratulations, you're done :) Have a cookie 🍪\n\n### Linux instructions\n\n* Set the Windows verison of the Wine prefix to Windows 10.\n  * `WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64/ WINEARCH=win64 winecfg`\n* Install the .NET 8 runtime. (For patcher only)\n  * `WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64/ WINEARCH=win64 winetricks dotnet8`\n* Install the .NET 8 desktop framework. (For patcher only)\n  * `WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64/ WINEARCH=win64 winetricks dotnetdesktop8`\n* Select the unpatched executable.\n  * `WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64/ WINEARCH=win64 wine patcher.exe`\n* Download Proton from [GloriousEggroll](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom) and install [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher). Launch the patched executable using umu.\n  * `WINEPREFIX=~/.wine64/ WINEARCH=win64 PROTONPATH=\"/home/tracer/GE-Proton10-25/\" umu-run GameClientApp.patched.exe`\n\n### Optional stuff\n\n* Download the [MonaspaceXenon](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) font and put the -regular.otf and -bold.otf in the directory of the game files.\n* Download the [Font Awesome v6](https://fontawesome.com/v6/download) free desktop font files and put the .otf files into the game directory.\n* Once first started, the library will create hashlibrary.json. You can add crc32 strings / elements to hash which will be displayed in various places where applicable. You can just add all the strings from the [overtools github repository](https://github.com/overtools/OWLib/tree/develop/TankLibHelper/DataPreHashChange). To do so add another root JSON element (an array) called \"add\" and put all your strings there.\n\n### Patcher & how it works\n\nThe patcher itself just goes to TlsCallback_0 and patches some bytes so the executable loads inject.dll before anything else. inject.dll then restores the game to its original state, decrypts everything and hooks stuff. Afterwards it runs the game normally. This was achieved with just copying the bytes which lazy_importer created for the LoadLibrary function and then calling LoadLibrary with \"inject.dll\" as an argument.\n\n## Compilation\n\n* You need Visual Studio 2022. I have not tested it on any other platform\n* Make sure to initialize the submodules / clone recursively\n* Initialize the vcpkg repository with the ps1 file located at external/vcpkg/scripts/bootstrap.ps1\n* Compile as Relaese/x64. No other configuration is tested  (some flags and settings are missing).\n\n# 2. Game internals\n\n## Managers\nThe first think Overwatch does is initialize all its \"Managers\". They handle things such as Dataflow, CASC, Window management, etc. This is the lowest level and not really interesting.\n\n## ECS\nAfterwards, all the Entity Admins get initialized. First the Lobby, then Game and finally Replay.\n\nThere is one Entity admin base class on which all others depend upon. The LobbyEntityAdmin includes some login and user information in the inherited class, though I have never really researched that.\n\nThe Game Enttiy Admin is the biggest one and contains amongst others:\n* An uint that says \"this is the local entity\". This must reference the controller ",

Make sure to try these:\n\n* Disable \"Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling\" (Windows Settings: Display -> Graphics -> Advanced)\n* Disable VRR (G-Sync, FreeSync etc.) and Smart VSync (ShaderBeam needs to run at VSync)\n* Disable HDR, it's not currently supported\n* Disable MPO using registry files from [here](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5157/~/after-updating-to-nvidia-game-ready-driver-461.09-or-newer%2C-some-desktop-apps) \n* Use only one monitor and disconnect any others\n* Set GPU settings to maximum performance (NVIDIA Control Panel: Power management mode)\n* Ensure \"Background Application Max Frame Rate\" is Off (NVIDIA Control Panel)\n* Use Process Lasso to max GPU priority of ShaderBeam process\n* Desktop can be a mixed bag, best used with borderless fullscreen games\n\n### Second GPU provides best experience\n\nBy using a second GPU to run the shader, it's possible to **eliminate desync/flashing\nissues** in most games. The shader has been optimized and at lower resolutions/refresh rates you\ncan even use an iGPU (for example Intel UHD 770 can do 1080p at 800fps+). You can use the Benchmark\nbutton in ShaderBeam to estimate maximum shading rate of your GPU.\n\nYou do not need to connect a display to the secondary GPU, keep everything plugged into\nyour primary GPU. In ShaderBeam, simply change Shader GPU to your iGPU or secondary dGPU.\n\n### Usage Guide\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you have an OLED, make sure to select it to disable LCD Anti-retention. It causes occasional\n> stutters as it desyncs CRT refresh rate from content refresh rate, and is not needed for OLEDs.\n\n* ShaderBeam is fullscreen-only, you can change the display to use via UI.\n* Upon startup ShaderBeam will automatically start simulation using default parameters.\n* You can change various render and shader parameters using the UI overlay.\n* Use pop-up tooltips to learn more about available options.\n* Click away from the UI to hide it and get back into the game (might need to click twice), use the hotkey to bring menu back.\n* Current global hotkeys are:\n  * Toggle UI -- Ctrl+Shift+B\n  * Force on top -- Ctrl+Shift+G\n  * Restart -- Ctrl+Shift+A\n  * Quit -- Ctrl+Shift+Q\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### > I get irregular flashing\n\nThis happens when ShaderBeam isn't given enough GPU time by the OS to present a frame\non time. It's more likely to happen the heavier game you are playing, and also some\ngames (especially Unreal Engine ones) create unavoidable GPU stalls even at low details.\n\nTry all the Tips above, especially disabling HAGS and MPO, or an older game.\nThe ",

Clicky, Twist and Momentum\n- RGB ring with configurable colours and 5 different display modes. Halo, Bands, Breath, Rainbow, Solid and Off.\n- Easy profile switching with up down profile buttons or profile list display.\n- The Last profile is stored to the SD card so the macro pad will start on whichever profile was last active.\n\n#### Bill of Materials\n\n1x 128x64 OLED Display - https://www.waveshare.com/2.42inch-oled-module.htm\n\n1x Magnetic Encoder Board - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007469177411.html\n\n1x 2804 100kv Brushless Gimbal Motor - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006008489660.html\n\n6x Kailh Low Profile Switches - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005066585322.html\n\n1x RP2040-Plus Board - https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-plus.htm\n\n1x TMC6300 Motor Driver Board - https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-brushless-motor-driver-3-phase-tmc6300.html\n\n1x Micro SD Module - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005010587984346.html\n\n4x 6x1mm Magnets - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009894772141.html\n\n2x Tactile Buttons - https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electronic-components/EVQ-Q2B03W/762882\n\nThe following parts are optional if you want to include the LEDS:\n\n20x WS2811 LED's - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32776731877.html\n\n20x 0.1uF (100nF) 0603 Capacitors - https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32966526545.html\n\n#### Hardware\n\n9x M3x5x5 Threaded Inserts (only needed for printed housing)\n\n3x M3x6 SHCS\n\n2x M3x10 SHCS\n\n10x M2.5x4 SHCS\n\n4x M3x6 CSK\n\n### Printing Instructions\n\n#### - Printed version\nPrint all files in the 3D Files/STL's folder. You will need 6 of the keycap file, two of the Menu button file and two of the PCB spacer file.\n\n\n#### - Machined Version\nPrint all files in the 3D Files/STL's folder except: \"Custom Keycap.STL\", \"Macro Pad - Printed Version.STL\" and \"Menu Button Printed.STL\"\nGet all of the .STEP files in the 3D Files/STEP folder machined. Don't include the Macropad Assembly .STEP file from the main directory as it is a complete model of Macro Pad rather than an individual part. If you supply the MacroPad Housing.PDF file with the housing, you can have the mounting holes tapped for you.\n\n### Motor Assembly\n\nI made this quick picture to show how the wheel motor gets assembled:\n\n![Alt text](MotorStack.png \"Motor Assembly\")\n\nThe \"Encoder Mount.STL\" part has two small holes in it that are supposed to get tapped to M2 for the encoder. If you don't have an M2 tap, you can probably just glue the encoder to the mount or even use some small self tapping screws to hold it in place.\n\nThe magnet holder should be a snug fit inside the hollow motor shaft. If it isn't, I'd recomend a drop of super glue to ensure it can't work free over time.\n\n### PCB's\n\nYou will need to have both PCB's made to complete this project. They are very simple PCB's with only two layers, so they should be cheap!\nJust upload the Zip files found in \"PCB's/MacroPad\" and \"PCB's/MacroPad Controller Board\" to your PCB manufacturer of choice and they shouldn't need any further info.\n\n#### - Controller Board\n\nThe controller board has the main components labelled so you should easily be able to tell where everything goes. I've also labelled power and ground connections on the motor controller and SD reader so just double check you are installing them up the correct way! The SD reader should be flat against the PCB as shown in the video, whilst the motor controller gets installed on its pin headers with the \"bottom\" of the board face up (the side with the pin labels should be showing). The Pico should also be soldered directly to the board with its USB port facing outwards.\nC1 on the Controller board is supposed to be a 10000pF 50v Capacitor. I never ended up fitting mine and I've had no issues but Sparkfun recommended it so I've left the pads there in case you decide to fit it.\n\n#### - Main Board\n\nIf you're planning to include the LED's, do them first! There should be one corner of the LED with an arrow shaped rebate. It should point away from the pad labelled with a \"1\". All of the C components on this board are 0.1uF 0603 size capacitors. They are also needed to make the LED's work.\n\nThe switches you need for two profile switching buttons are: EVQ-Q2B03W\n\nThey share the same footprint as the EVQ-Q2B02W's but are a bit taller so be careful to en",

      "readme": "﻿# Moonwalk++ \r\n\r\nPoC Implementation combining Stack Moonwalking and Memory Encryption.\r\n\r\n## TL;DR\r\n\r\nMoonwalk++ is a PoC implementation of an enahnced version of [StackMoonwalk](https://github.com/klezVirus/SilentMoonwalk), which combines its original technique to remove the caller from the call stack, with a memory self-encryption routine, using ROP to both desynchronize unwinding from control flow and simultaneously encrypt the executing shellcode to hide it from inpection.\r\n\r\n**Read more in the Blog Post:** [Malware Just Got Its Free Passes Back!](https://klezvirus.github.io/posts/Moonwalk-plus-plus/). \r\n\r\n## Is it Moonwalk++? (or minus minus --?)\r\n\r\nGitHub will not allow the name to contain `+`, so well, it is named `--` but should have been `++`. Give or take, who cares?\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis repository demonstrates a PoC implementation to spoof the call stack when calling arbitrary Windows APIs, while simultanously encrypt the executing shellcode. \r\n\r\nAn extensive overview of the technique and why it was developed can be read [here](https://klezvirus.github.io/posts/Moonwalk-plus-plus/).\r\n\r\nThis POC was made to work ONLY when injecting to `OneDrive.exe`. As such, in order to replicate its behaviour, you would need to ensure OneDrive is installed and running. Afterwards, retrieve one of the PID the program instantiates:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-Process OneDrive) | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_.Id}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd provide the tool with one of them:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nMoonwalk++ <PID-of-OneDrive>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Injection\r\n\r\nThe POC is expecting a PID of `OneDrive.exe` to be provided as a CLI argument. The first frame is selected from the `OneDrive.exe` executable loaded from a well-defined location (i.e. `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft OneDrive\\OneDrive.exe`)\r\n\r\n### OPSEC.. what?\r\n\r\nThis proof of concept has minimal operational security and is intentionally rough. Its primary purpose is to substantiate the theoretical claims discussed in the blog post [Malware Just Got Its Free Passes Back!](https://klezvirus.github.io/posts/Moonwalk-plus-plus/). \r\n\r\n## Execute\r\n\r\nCareful when testing! The Loader will cause OneDrive to pop a MessageBox, but the popup may not be visible immediately, and if you keep going with the loader BEFORE cliclicking on the \"OK\" button of MessageBox, it will crash the process! The correct execution order is: \r\n\r\n1. Execute moonwalk (print first messages)\r\n2. Check that all the gadgets have been correctly identified\r\n3. Press Enter to Execute once\r\n4. At this stage, an Icon in the TaskBar (OneDrive Directory) should have apepared, click on it, it will reveal the MessageBox popup\r\n5. Click OK on the MessageBox so the Thread can return and execute the appropriate decryption chains\r\n6. Now go back to the Moonwalk console and you can repeat the process\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\nIn order to build the POC and observe a similar behaviour to the one in the picture, ensure to:\r\n\r\n* Disable GS (`/GS-`)\r\n* Disable Code Optimisation (`/Od`)\r\n* Disable Whole Program Optimisation (Remove `/GL`)\r\n* Disable size and speed preference (Remove `/Os`, `/Ot`)\r\n* **Enable** intrinsic if not enabled (`/Oi`)\r\n\r\n## Previous Work and Credits\r\n\r\nCheck [SilentMoowalk#PreviousWork](https://github.com/klezVirus/SilentMoonwalk?tab=readme-ov-file#previous-work).\r\n\r\n## Technical Notes (17/12/2025)\r\n\r\n* For this specific POC, I used some very, very specific gadget `wininet.dll` to bypass Eclipse. This gadget is not found in all builds and is version dependent. I extended the check to ensure that if there is a compatible gadget is going to be used.\r\n* In a similar way, the Big Stack Pivot gadget in KernelBase `ADD RSP, 0x1538`had a similar limitation. To make this more stable I updated the POC to dynamically search a general BIG pattern in multiple DLLs  and dynamically extract the size. Any size bigger than 0x500 bytes is considered fine by the POC.\r\n* Another bug I was notified about pertained to the `SetThreadContext` API. On certain machines, I had to use a non-volatile register to pass the references to the SPOOFER configuration while hijacking the thread context.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to [Samir Bousseaden](https://x.com/SBousseaden) for notifing the issues!\r\n\r\n## Additional Notes\r\n\r\n* This POC was made only to support and proof the feasibility to combine Stack Moonwalk and Memory Encryption. As the previous POC (SilentMoonwalk), it is not production ready and needs a lot of testing before integrating into C2 frameworks or similar. Use at your own risk.\r\n* I'm not planning extensions for this technique, at least for now.\r\n",

TongSIM constructs 100+ diverse multi-room indoor scenarios alongside an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor simulated town, and incorporates thousands of interactive 3D object models spanning 500+ categories.\n\nCurrently, indoor rooms are fully accessible, while outdoor environments remain under continuous development and optimization. We will gradually open access to these outdoor assets based on actual research needs, with the goal of providing more comprehensive support for the scientific work of our community's researchers. Please stay tuned for updates.\n\nOn top of the environment, TongSIM provides a comprehensive evaluation system and a suite of benchmarks covering major agent capabilities: perception, cognition, decision-making, learning, execution, and social collaboration. The platform also offers high-fidelity and customizable scenes, rich annotations, and parallel training to accelerate research and development of general embodied intelligence.\n\nThis repository contains:\n\n- Unreal Engine project (`unreal/`)\n- Python SDK and examples (`src/`, `examples/`)\n- Documentation site sources (`docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`)\n\n## Highlights\n\n- High-fidelity indoor + outdoor worlds: 100+ multi-room indoor scenes and an open-ended outdoor town\n- Large-scale interactive assets: thousands of objects spanning 500+ categories\n- Benchmarks and evaluation: perception, cognition, decision-making, learning, execution, and social collaboration\n- Multimodal perception: built-in vision and audio; extensible to other modalities\n- Physics-consistent simulation with causal world dynamics and rich annotations\n- Parallel simulation for scalable training\n- Easy integration: Python SDK over gRPC with practical examples\n- Extensible, plugin-oriented architecture\n\n## Requirements\n\n- OS: Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 22.04\n- Unreal Engine: 5.6 (install via Epic Games Launcher)\n- Python: 3.12+\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Python Installation\n\nUse either `uv` (recommended) or plain `pip`.\n\n#### Option A: uv (recommended)\n\n1.

Get binary mask for specific item\n- `save_vox(path)` - Save to MagicaVoxel format\n- `summary()` - Get human-readable summary\n\n#### `Voxelizer`\n\nMesh to voxel grid converter.\n\n```python\nVoxelizer(resolution: int = 128)\n```\n\n**Methods:**\n- `voxelize_file(path)` - Voxelize a mesh file\n- `voxelize_mesh(vertices, faces)` - Voxelize from arrays\n\n## Algorithm\n\nThe spectral packing algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. **Voxelization**: Convert 3D meshes to binary occupancy grids (using [VoxSurf](https://github.com/sylefeb/VoxSurf))\n2. **Collision Detection**: Use FFT correlation to efficiently compute\n   where items can be placed without collision\n3. **Scoring**: For each valid position, compute a score based on:\n   - Proximity to existing items (encourages tight packing)\n   - Height penalty (prefers bottom placements)\n4. **Greedy Placement**: Place items one by one in descending volume order\n\n## Examples\n\nSee the `examples/` directory for complete examples:\n\n- `basic_packing.py` - Simple packing demonstration\n- `benchmark.py` - Performance benchmarking\n- `github_teaser.py` - Generate the README teaser renders (requires Blender)\n\n### Blender Export Example\n\nThe t",

Proxy-Provider 模式 🛡️\n\n**使用 Mihomo 的 Proxy-Provider 机制**  \n\n订阅链接**不再下载解析**，而是生成客户端可直接使用的配置，交由用户客户端的 Mihomo 内核自行拉取订阅：\n\n```yaml\nproxy-providers:\n  provider_1:\n    type: http\n    url: https://your-subscription-url  # <-- 客户端直接连接机场\n    interval: 3600\n    path: ./providers/provider_1.yaml\n    health-check:\n      enable: true\n      interval: 600\n      url: http://www.gstatic.com/generate_204\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> * 使用 proxy-provider 后，由你的客户端内核以**直连**的形式自行拉取订阅。  \n> * 订阅是否能成功，**与本后端无关，与规则无关**。效果等同于你自己制作 yaml 并填写订阅链接。  \n> * 如遇拉取不成功，说明你的订阅链接在国内无法正常直连访问（至少在你所在的位置是如此），请和机场客服对线。\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **优势**：\n>\n> * ✅ 不再干涉用户节点，交由内核原生处理\n> * ✅ 订阅更新由客户端控制，无需重新转换\n> * ✅ 避免机场屏蔽转换服务器的问题\n\n#### 2. Mihomo 内核模块集成 🧩\n\n直接使用 Mihomo Go 库解析节点链接，确保：\n\n* ✅ 支持 Mihomo 的所有协议（包括 `hysteria2`, `tuic`, `anytls` 等）\n* ✅ 参数完全兼容，无需手动适配\n* ✅ 新协议零延迟支持（编译时跟随 Mihomo 更新）\n\n#### 3. 兼容性保证 🤝\n\n* ✅ **无缝切换**：完全兼容传统 subconverter 的 API 接口，确保客户端用户零学习成本，无缝切换。\n* ✅ **模板兼容**：继续沿用传统的订阅转换外部模板，无需修正任何内容，由后端内置逻辑确保 `proxy-provider` 模式在分流规则中正确生成。\n* ✅ **无忧更新**：编译时自动遍历 [Mihomo 内核仓库](https://github.com/MetaCubeX/mihomo)，提取并写入当前最新支持的协议格式，确保永远支持最新协议。\n\n#### 4. 新手友好 👶\n\n* ✅ 使用 **[Custom_OpenClash_Rules](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules)** 远程配置模板替代默认模板\n* ✅ 锁死 API 模式，避免新手误配置降低安全性\n* ✅ 简化参数，专注核心功能\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 快速开始\n\n### 🌍 使用公共后端 (无需部署)\n\n如果你不想折腾服务器，可以直接使用我们提供的公共后端：\n\n> [!TIP]\n> **公共后端地址**：`https://api.asailor.org`\n\n你可以在任何支持自定义后端的订阅转换网站或客户端中填入此地址即可使用。\n\n### 🐳 自行部署 (Docker)\n\n如果你拥有自己的服务器，推荐使用 Docker 进行部署。\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> **代码尚不完善，推荐优先使用公共后端。**\n>\n> *由于开发者业余时间有限，以下部署指南部分内容由 AI 生成，仅供参考。*\n\n#### 1. 一键启动\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name subconverter \\\n  -p 25500:25500 \\\n  --restart unless-stopped \\\n  aethersailor/subconverter-extended:latest\n```\n\n访问 `http://localhost:25500/version` 验证部署。\n\n#### 2. 自定义配置启动\n\n```bash\n# 1. 创建配置目录\nmkdir -p ~/subconverter/base\n\n# 2. 下载配置文件模板（可选）\nwget -O ~/subconverter/base/pref.toml \\\n  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aethersailor/SubConverter-Extended/master/base/pref.example.toml\n\n# 3. 启动容器并挂载配置\ndocker run -d \\\n  --na",

Moreover, \r\nthe gadget chosen to save the return value cannot be used to execute functions with more than 4 arguments (technically 5, but you'll lose a volatile register in the process and that's not recommended).\r\n\r\n## Previous Work \r\n\r\n* [Hiding In PlainSight - Indirect Syscall is Dead! Long Live Custom Call Stacks](https://0xdarkvortex.dev/hiding-in-plainsight/)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* [namazso](https://x.com/namazso): stack unwinding inner mechanics, retaddr/frame spoofing, and more\r\n* [Chetan Nayak](https://x.com/NinjaParanoid): previous public work on implementing ThreadPool Worker Callback as a tailcall\r\n* [trickster](https://x.com/trickster012): for giving me a reason and a motivation to rework on this",

While it offers nothing groundbreaking it is based on popular units like *ReplikaXT* and *EchoBoy*. The main goal is to create a free and open plug-in for my own productions, an alternative to the popular [Deelay](https://sixthsample.com/deelay/) by *SixthSample* without premium versions or trimmed features or on-line activation.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n![Screenshot](./doc/qdelay.png)\n\n</div>\n\n## Features\n\n  * **Stereo Dual Delay** with independent delay times and multiple modes.\n  * **Ping-Pong mode** with feedback width control.\n  * **Tap mode** with offset time (tap) and delay time.\n  * **Swing and Feel** offset.\n  * **Accent** odd or even taps.\n  * **Reverse** delay.\n  * **Parametric EQ** on feedback and input signal.\n  * **Diffusion** on pre or post delay signal.\n  * **Modulation** of delay line time.\n  * **Pitch Shifter** on the feedback or post delay signal.\n  * **Saturation** on pre and post delay signal (optionally on Feedback path).\n  * **Color, Bias and Dynamics** controls for saturation.\n  * **Ducking** to muffle the delayed signal on input.\n  * **Tape wow and flutter** to add tone variation.\n  * **Taps preview** display.\n\n## Download\n\n* [Download latest release](https://github.com/tiagolr/qdelay/releases)\n* Current builds include VST3 for Windows, VST3 and LV2 for Linux and AU and VST3 for macOS.\n\n## About\n\n**QDelay** [started as a JSFX](https://github.com/tiagolr/tilr_jsfx?tab=readme-ov-file#qdelay) a few years ago to have a quick delay with basic features like Ping-Pong, cutoff and pitch shift. Like other plug-ins I've rebuilt, the goal is to make an improved version using better tools with better visuals, performance etc.\n\nI decided to build a plug-in that could come somewhat close to EchoBoy in terms of capabilities, the result is good enough but probably nowhere near the quality of Saturations or Tape emulations that SoundToys and Native Instruments engineers can achieve. The distortion unit is based of [JClones TapeHead](https://github.com/JClones/JSFXClones/blob/master/JClones_TapeHead.md) - an open JSFX tape like distortion.\n\nFor the pitch shift, I couldn't find many solutions for a zero latency pitch shift that I could adapt to this project, so I went with what I know and ported Saike's [Pitch_Shift](https://github.com/JoepVanlier/JSFX/blob/master/Basics/Saike_Pitch_Shift.jsfx) library from JSFX to c++ and JUCE. The result is surprisingly good and it's impressive the number of people looking for a solution like this in JUCE forums and other places.\n\nDelay swing is implemented using serial delay lines with different times and Feel/Offset is implemented in a hacky way by shifting the write position of the input in relation to the feedback with some extra care to pick the leading write to override the circular buffer while the trailing write overdubs the existing contents.\n\nTape Flutter and Wow, is taken from ChowDSP [AnalogTapeModel](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/AnalogTapeModel).\n\nFor future work things can be added like multiple taps per delay like EchoBoy or Valhalla delay, better saturations and more delay modes.\n\nFeel free to explore the repository for snippets on parametric EQs, envelope followers, pitch shifting etc.. or most likely just download the plug-in and have fun with it.\n\n## Tips\n\nCurrent signal routing:\n\n```\nInput > EQ Input > Saturation Pre > Diffusion Pre >\n[Delay <-> Modulation <-> EQ Feedback <-> Pitch Feedback <-> Saturation Feedback] >\nPitch Post > Tape Wow/Flutter > Saturation Post > Diffusion Post > Output\n```\n\n* Diffusion and Pitch shift can be configured to be Pre|Post or Feedback|Post in the settings menu.\n* Saturation can run on the feedback loop for analog tape distortion, with caution, it adds energy each feedback pass.\n* In **Tap** mode the first time controls the offset (tap), the second is the delay time.\n*",

      "readme": "# Zyrox LLVM Obfuscator\n\n### llvm compile and link-time plugin for obfuscating native code\n\n# Why\n\nwhy not ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\nOne of my biggest projects, where I learned a lot about LLVM internals, binary formats, assembly and obfuscation techniques.\n\nI believe that learning through building is the best way to learn, thus I built this project to learn more about these topics.\n\n# Research\n\nI have wrote 4 blogs explaining the concepts behind [Zyrox](https://peterr.dev/blogs/zyrox):\n\n-   [Part I: Building Zyrox: A Custom LLVM Obfuscator](https://peterr.dev/blogs/zyrox/llvm-obfuscator-part-one)\n-   [Part II: Control Flow Flattening](https://peterr.dev/blogs/zyrox/llvm-obfuscator-part-two)\n-   [Part III: Encrypted Jump Tables](https://peterr.dev/blogs/zyrox/llvm-obfuscator-part-three)\n-   [Part IV: The Finale](https://peterr.dev/blogs/zyrox/llvm-obfuscator-part-four)\n\nThese parts go deeper than this readme, and definitely worth a read if you are interested in the topic.\n\n# Building\n\n## From Template (Quick Start, Recommended)\n\nThis is intended for who wants to _quick test_ Zyrox, or learn how to integrate it in a cmake project.\n\nFollow the steps in [Zyrox Template](https://github.com/PeterHackz/zyrox-template) repo.\n\n## From Source\n\ninstall llvm:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install llvm-18 llvm-18-dev clang-18\n```\n\nclone and compile zyrox:\n\n```shell\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PeterHackz/zyrox.git\ncd zyrox\ncmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++\ncmake --build build --parallel 4\n```\n\n## Python (Post-Compile) Plugin setup\n\nmake sure you have python3 and pip installed.\n\n### Setup an Environment (Recommended)\n\n```bash\n# Create a virtual environment\npython3 -m venv .venv\n\n# Activate the env\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Install Globally\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n# Usage\n\n## Quick Usage\n\n```shell\nclang -O0 -flto=full -c main.c -o out/main.o\nclang -flto=full -fuse-ld=lld -Wl,--load-pass-plugin=./build/libzyrox.so out/main.o -o out/main\n```\n\nAfter obfuscation, run `PyPlugin.py` to encrypt jump tables:\n\n```shell\n# if you installed dependencies in a virtual environment, activate it first:\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n#  then run with:\npython PyPlugin.py --in=<input_file> [--out=<output_file>] [--tables=<zyrox_tables_file>] [--android]\n```\n\n## With CMake\n\nCheck out the [Zyrox Template](https://github.com/PeterHackz/zyrox-template) repo for an example CMake integration.\n\n# Contacts\n\nI get this is a complex topic, and this project was mostly for educational purposes, as well as to serve BSD Brawl.\nIf you have any question, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me:\n\n-   Discord: `@s.b`\n-   Email: `mail@peterr.dev` or `me@peterr.dev`\n-   [Discord Server](https://discord.peterr.dev)\n\nany help, through pull requests or issues is appreciated!\n\n# How it works\n\n`ZyroxPlugin.cpp` registers the pass, then links `siphash` (more on this later) and call `StringEncryption` to encrypt\nstrings.\n\nThe reason we encrypt strings early is so that decryption logic gets obfuscated too later.\n\nthen it calls `ModuleUtils::ExpandCustomAnnotations`\nand `QuickConfig::RegisterPasses` to parse all `__attribute__((annotate(\"...\")))` expressions and run\nQuickJs config (located in `ZyroxConfig.js`)\n\nEvery function is obfuscated by calling `Zyrox::RunOnFunction` located in `ZyroxCore.cpp`,\nmore documentation about this will be provided in the future.\n\n# Extra Util\n\nswitches create jump tables and PHI nodes are annoying to deal with thus we use `FunctionUtils` and `BasicBlockUtils`\nto flatten (into if statements) and demote these respectively.\n\n# Passes\n\noh man, where do I start\n\n-   [Basic Block Splitter](#basic-block-splitter)\n-   [Control Flow Flattening](#control-flow-flattening)\n-   [Indirect Branching](#indirect-branching)\n-   [Simple Indirect Branching](#simple-indirect-branching)\n-   [Mixed Boolean Arithmetic](#mixed-boolean-arithmetic)\n\nall js-plugin args are in `index.d.ts` so will not be talked about in this documentation.\n\nfor annotations documentation, [click here](#zyrox-annotations)\n\n# Basic Block Splitter\n\nThis pass splits and shuffles a basic block into smaller ones. suppose we have this:\n\n```c++\nint __test_fn(int x)\n{\n    if (x == 2) {\n        printf(\"x is 2\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"x is not 2!, x is: %d\\n\", x);\n    }\n    return x + 4 * x - 2 / 4;\n}\n```\n\nwhich gets compiled into:\n\n```asm\ndefine internal i32 @__test_fn(i32 noundef %0) #0 !zyrox !8 !obfuscated !11 {\n  %2 = alloca i32, align 4\n  store i32 %0, ptr %2, align 4\n  %3 = load i32, ptr %2, align 4\n  %4 = icmp eq i32 %3, 2\n  br i1 %4, label %5, label %7\n\n5:                                                ;
