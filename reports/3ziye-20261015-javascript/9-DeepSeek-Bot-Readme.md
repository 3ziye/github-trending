# DeepSeek Bot

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.1_preview-blue) ![DSH](https://img.shields.io/badge/DSH-0.2.0--rc.2-4D6BFE) ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2.0-green)

DeepSeek Bot (DS Bot) is a bot plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH). It turns DSH into bots. You create your own bots, then talk and work with them.

## Install

First install DSH and set up at least one model in it. DS Bot uses the models from DSH.

**DSH Desktop (Windows, macOS)**

1. In the sidebar, select **Plugins** → **Add plugin**.
2. In **Package name or address**, enter `ds-bot`. In mainland China, set **Registry** to **Mainland China mirror**.
3. Select **Install**, then **Enable now**. If DSH says the change takes effect at the next start, quit DSH completely and open it again.

If npm is not reachable, in step 2 you can also enter the full path of `ds-bot-0.1.6.tgz` downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot/releases), or `github:Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot#v0.1.6&path:/ds-bot` (needs Git).

**DSH Web (Windows, macOS, Linux)**

Needs Node.js `22.19` or later, and pnpm.

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2 plugin --profile web add ds-bot
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2 web
```

## Setup

I strongly recommend that you set up your other bots and group chats by just talking to a bot.

## Features

### Bot

You can do all your talking and work with one bot, in one window. You don't need to worry about the context behind it. The bot's details page shows its info, and there you can pick the model you want it to use. You can switch models at any time, but I still recommend that you keep one model for a bot for a long time, and switch only when you really need to.

Bots also have memory. A bot remembers what you like and uses it in later work. You can manage its memory on the bot's details page, or just tell the bot.

### Main bot

The main bot is your chief. It has very high rights: it manages the other bots and the group chats. The first time you open DS Bot, there is already a main bot called Chief. Talk to it, and it walks you through the setup.

In short: have a question? Ask the main bot.

### Group chats

DS Bot has group chats. A group chat is a great way to get several bots to work together, but it clearly costs more. So DS Bot does this: every group chat has an admin. The admin answers your messages by default and calls in the other bots for you. You can also @ a bot directly, and it answers you directly: type @ and pick the bot from the list. To give the bots another chat as context, use + → Reference a chat in the message box.

Any bot can hand work to another bot with @. That bot does the work on its own, and the group goes on. While it works, it keeps the group posted, and the group, the sidebar and its own chat show what it is doing. When it is done, it posts the result in the group, and the bot that asked for the work answers. To stop the work, open the group's details.

### Capabilities

Settings → **Capabilities** is a shared library of MCP servers, skills and packs. Add a capability to a Bot in its settings; it is available from that Bot's next message in its own chat and group chats. A local MCP command that a Bot adds needs your approval before it can run. While other Bots use a capability, only you or a Main Bot can change or delete it.

### Usage

In **Settings** → **Usage**, you can see token usage by time, by bot and by model.

## Data

All data stays on your own computer, in `bot/` and `sessions/` in the DSH home folder (`~/.dsh` by default). Uninstalling the plugin does not delete this data.

## Development

The plugin source is in [`ds-bot/`](ds-bot/). For options and internals, see [`ds-bot/README.md`](ds-bot/README.md). For development, tests and how the team works, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For changes between versions, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
