> The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.

This repo is a full-stack implementation of an LLM like ChatGPT in a single, clean, minimal, hackable, dependency-lite codebase. nanochat is designed to run on a single 8XH100 node via scripts like [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh), that run the entire pipeline start to end. This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.

## Talk to it

To get a sense of the endpoint of this repo, you can currently find [nanochat d32](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/8) hosted on [nanochat.karpathy.ai](https://nanochat.karpathy.ai/). "d32" means that this model has 32 layers in the Transformer neural network. This model has 1.9 billion parameters, it was trained on 38 billion tokens by simply running the single script [run1000.sh](run1000.sh), and the total cost of training was ~$800 (about 33 hours training time on 8XH100 GPU node). While today this is enough to outperform GPT-2 of 2019, it falls dramatically short of modern Large Language Models like GPT-5. When talking to these micro models, you'll see that they make a lot of mistakes, they are a little bit naive and silly and they hallucinate a ton, a bit like children. It's kind of amusing. But what makes nanochat unique is that it is fully yours - fully configurable, tweakable, hackable, and trained by you from start to end. To train and talk to your own, we turn to...

## Quick start

The fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh), which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:

```bash
bash speedrun.sh
```

Alternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session `speedrun` (and also log output to `speedrun.log`):

```bash
screen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh
```

See the [screen cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jctosta/af918e1618682638aa82) if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with `Ctrl-a d` and `tail speedrun.log` to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:

```bash
python -m scripts.chat_web
```

And then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).

You can also `cat report.md` file which appeared in the project directory and contains the "report card" of the run, i.e. a bunch of evaluations and metrics. At the very end, you'll see a summary table, for example:

(Your table might be missing the RL number by default).

## Bigger models

Unsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~1
