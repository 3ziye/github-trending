# DiPlay

**CarPlay for compatible BYD Android head units.** Wired and wireless, with the familiar DiAuto interface. Independent app: `com.shihab.diplay`.

> **BYD support scope:** These projects focus on BYD cars. They may work on other brands, but other brands are unsupported and there are no plans to add support or fix brand-specific incompatibilities.

## 0.2.16 — public preview

Install on the **car**, not the iPhone. No jailbreak, dongle, Mac, account or authentication server is required for use. Core CarPlay does not require ADB; optional dashboard, battery, wheel-speed and parked-video features do. Your head unit must permit APK installation. The APK supports Android 7.1+ (API 25); Android 7.1–8.1 support is not yet confirmed on a vehicle. Wireless supports Wi-Fi Direct, the car’s existing hotspot or Existing Wi-Fi / Same LAN. Android 7.1–9 Wi-Fi Direct uses a firmware-dependent legacy path with generated group credentials and unverified requested frequency; see [Android 9 Wi-Fi Direct](docs/ANDROID9_WIFI_DIRECT.md). Android 10+ verifies its negotiated group frequency.

- Wired USB and wireless CarPlay with local authentication.
- BYD HUD navigation with arrows, distance and street names on verified firmware.
- Car hotspot support, improved audio buffering and saved receive diagnostics.
- Automatic address discovery, fixed-channel Wi-Fi fallbacks and successful-configuration memory.
- Icon/text size, resolution and frame rate; applying a display change reconnects CarPlay.
- Local diagnostic export. Reports are sent only if you choose to share them.
- Separate installation alongside DiAuto. Run one projection app at a time.

This is **not an Apple-certified product**. The APK bundles an experimental accessory identity recovered from public Carlinkit firmware, not a newly provisioned MFi identity for DiPlay. A bundled private key is extractable. Acceptance after future iOS updates, reliability across head units and suitability of that identity for general distribution are unresolved. This release invites community testing; it is not a guarantee of universal compatibility.

Earlier releases were tested on the development DiLink5.1 car: live windshield guidance and street names work, Car hotspot now starts CarPlay, and Wi-Fi Direct performance is substantially improved. Audio underrun recovery is improved in 0.2.15; remaining cutouts need current diagnostic reports. The 0.2.16 software Opus microphone fallback was accepted on a BOS Mini A1 head unit (Android 9) with an iPhone 12 on iOS 27. The floating-map test build was installed on the development DiLink 5.1 car; feedback led to the pinch corrections in 0.2.9. Earlier wheel-speed and video contributions were tested on a BYD Tang with DiLink 5.0 and an iPhone 15 Pro on iOS 27; wheel-speed dead reckoning in tunnels remains unverified. Broader head-unit and iOS compatibility is not guaranteed. The HUD firmware scope and cleanup limits are documented in [BYD navigation](docs/BYD_NAVIGATION.md).

## What’s new in 0.2.16

- Siri and wireless calls send the microphone on Android 7.1–9 head units without an Opus encoder, using a bundled software Opus encoder.
- Wired USB fixes for NCM framing and Android 8 reads, with smaller-read retries when a head unit rejects a large read.
- Wireless recovery: hotspot address refresh after a first-connection timeout, Android 17 local-network permission, VPN-authorization crash handling and WPA3 car-hotspot security.
- Experimental Low-latency decoding and Direct video output, an FPS counter in Diagnostics, and bounded video backlog recovery.
- Inline Settings search, a confirmation before the quick menu discards unapplied changes, and an Off option for the CarPlay swipe-down gesture.
- 1% dashboard marker sliders, separate small-window turn-card placement, a resizable side panel and a themed cluster waiting screen.
- Experimental, off-by-default vehicle options: car Bluetooth pause during CarPlay, music-following ambient lighting, navigation wheel volume and a Platform 21 instrument route.

See [0.2.16 release notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.16.md) and [validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for contribution links and remaining physical tests. General stutter, calls/Siri, decoder and model-specific reports still need current-device evidence. [0.2.15 notes](docs/RELEASE-NOTES-0.2.15.md) remain available as historical guidance.

If a problem remains, reproduce it on **0.2.16**, then use **Settings → Diagnostics → Save diagnostic report**. Android 10+ normally saves to **Downloads/DiPlay**; Android 7.1–9 uses the document picker. If unavailable, use **View report** or **Share** from the confirmation, which identifies external/private fallback storage. Review the `.txt` and add it to
