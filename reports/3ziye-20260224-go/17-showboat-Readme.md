Create executable demo documents that show and prove an agent's work.

Showboat helps agents build markdown documents that mix commentary, executable code blocks, and captured output. These documents serve as both readable documentation and reproducible proof of work. A verifier can re-execute all code blocks and confirm the outputs still match.

## Example

Here's [an example Showboat demo document](https://github.com/simonw/showboat-demos/blob/main/shot-scraper/README.md) that demonstrates [shot-scraper](https://github.com/shot-scraper). It was created by Claude Code, as shown by [this transcript](https://gisthost.github.io/?29b0d0ebef50c57e7985a6004aad01c4/page-001.html#msg-2026-02-06T07-33-41-296Z).

## Installation

This Go tool can be installed directly [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/showboat/) using `pip` or `uv`.

You can run it without installing it first using `uvx`:

```bash
uvx showboat --help
```
Or install it like this, then run `showboat --help`:
```bash
uv tool install showboat
# or
pip install showboat
```

You can also install the Go binary directly:
```bash
go install github.com/simonw/showboat@latest
```
Or run it without installation like this:
```bash
go run github.com/simonw/showboat@latest --help
```
Compiled binaries are available [on the releases page](https://github.com/simonw/showboat/releases). On macOS you may need to [follow these extra steps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) to use those.

## Help

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
import subprocess
result = subprocess.run(["go", "run", ".", "--help"], capture_output=True, text=True)
cog.out(
    "````\n{}\n````\n".format(result.stdout.strip())
)

showboat - Create executable demo documents that show and prove an agent's work.

Showboat helps agents build markdown documents that mix commentary, executable
code blocks, and captured output. These documents serve as both readable
documentation and reproducible proof of work. A verifier can re-execute all
code blocks and confirm the outputs still match.

Usage:
  showboat init <file> <title>             Create a new demo document
  showboat note <file> [text]              Append commentary (text or stdin)
  showboat exec <file> <lang> [code]       Run code and capture output
  showboat image <file> <path>             Copy image into document
  showboat image <file> '![alt](path)'   Copy image with alt text
  showboat pop <file>                      Remove the most recent entry
  showboat verify <file> [--output <new>]  Re-run and diff all code blocks
  showboat extract <file> [--filename <name>]  Emit commands to recreate file

Global Options:
  --workdir <dir>   Set working directory for code execution (default: current)
  --version         Print version and exit
  --help, -h        Show this help message

Exec output:
  The "exec" command prints the captured shell output to stdout and exits with
  the same exit code as the executed command. This lets agents see what happened
  and react to errors. The output is still appended to the document regardless
  of exit code. Use "pop" to remove a failed entry.

    $ showboat exec demo.md bash "echo hello && exit 1"
    hello
    $ echo $?
    1

Image:
  The "image" command accepts a path to an image file or a markdown image
  reference of the form ![alt text](path). The image is copied into the same
  directory as the document with a generated filename and an image reference is
  appended to the markdown. When a markdown reference is provided the alt text
  is preserved; otherwise it is derived from the generated filename.

Pop:
  The "pop" command removes the most recent entry from a document. For an "exec"
  or "image" entry this removes both the code block and its output. For a "note"
  entry it removes the single commentary block. This is useful when a command
  produces an error that shouldn't remain in the document.

Verify:
  Re-runs every code block (skipping image blocks) and compares actual output
  against the recorded output. Prints diffs and exits with code 1 if any output
  has changed; exits 0 if everything matches. Use --output <file> to write an
  updated copy of the document with the new outputs without modifying the
  original.

Extract:
  Parses a document and prints the sequence of showboat CLI commands (one per
  line) that would recreate it from scratch. Output blocks are omitted since
  they are regenerated by "exec". Use --filename <name> to substitute a
  different filename
