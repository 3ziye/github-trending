This work presents **Depth Anything 3 (DA3)**, a model that predicts spatially consistent geometry from
arbitrary visual inputs, with or without known camera poses.
In pursuit of minimal modeling, DA3 yields two key insights:
- 💎 A **single plain transformer** (e.g., vanilla DINO encoder) is sufficient as a backbone without architectural specialization,
- ✨ A singular **depth-ray representation** obviates the need for complex multi-task learning.

🏆 DA3 significantly outperforms
[DA2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2) for monocular depth estimation,
and [VGGT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vggt) for multi-view depth estimation and pose estimation.
All models are trained exclusively on **public academic datasets**.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🏆 Model Zoo
We release three series of models, each tailored for specific use cases in visual geometry.

- 🌟 **DA3 Main Series** (`DA3-Giant`, `DA3-Large`, `DA3-Base`, `DA3-Small`) These are our flagship foundation models, trained with a unified depth-ray representation. By varying the input configuration, a single model can perform a wide range of tasks:
  + 🌊 **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Predicts a depth map from a single RGB image.
  + 🌊 **Multi-View Depth Estimation**: Generates consistent depth maps from multiple images for high-quality fusion.
  + 🎯 **Pose-Conditioned Depth Estimation**: Achieves superior depth consistency when camera poses are provided as input.
  + 📷 **Camera Pose Estimation**:  Estimates camera extrinsics and intrinsics from one or more images.
  + 🟡 **3D Gaussian Estimation**: Directly predicts 3D Gaussians, enabling high-fidelity novel view synthesis.

- 📐 **DA3 Metric Series** (`DA3Metric-Large`) A specialized model fine-tuned for metric depth estimation in monocular settings, ideal for applications requiring real-world scale.

- 🔍 **DA3 Monocular Series** (`DA3Mono-Large`). A dedicated model for high-quality relative monocular depth estimation. Unlike disparity-based models (e.g.,  [Depth Anything 2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2)), it directly predicts depth, resulting in superior geometric accuracy.

🔗 Leveraging these available models, we developed a **nested series** (`DA3Nested-Giant-Large`). This series combines a any-view giant model with a metric model to reconstruct visual geometry at a real-world metric scale.

### 🛠️ Codebase Features
Our repository is designed to be a powerful and user-friendly toolkit for both practical application and future research.
- 🎨 **Interactive Web UI & Gallery**: Visualize model outputs and compare results with an easy-to-use Gradio-based web interface.
- ⚡ **Flexible Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Powerful and scriptable CLI for batch processing and integration into custom workflows.
- 💾 **Multiple Export Formats**: Save your results in various formats, including `glb`, `npz`, depth images, `ply`, 3DGS videos, etc, to seamlessly connect with other tools.
- 🔧 **Extensible and Modular Design**:
