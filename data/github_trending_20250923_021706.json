Conceptually similar to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which lives *within* a model, this system selects the best *entire model* for the nature of the task.\n\nAs such, the overall inference accuracy is improved by using a pool of models that are better suited for different types of tasks:\n\n![Model Accuracy](./website/static/img/category_accuracies.png)\n\nThe screenshot below shows the LLM Router dashboard in Grafana.\n\n![LLM Router Dashboard](./website/static/img/grafana_screenshot.png)\n\nThe router is implemented in two ways: \n\n- Golang (with Rust FFI based on the [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) rust ML framework)\n- Python\nBenchmarking will be conducted to determine the best implementation.\n\n#### Auto-Selection of Tools\n\nSelect the tools to use based on the prompt, avoiding the use of tools that are not relevant to the prompt so as to reduce the number of prompt tokens and improve tool selection accuracy by the LLM.\n\n### Enterprise Security 🔒\n\n#### PII detection\n\nDetect PII in the prompt, avoiding sending PII to the LLM so as to protect the privacy of the user.\n\n#### Prompt guard\n\nDetect if the prompt is a jailbreak prompt, avoiding sending jailbreak prompts to the LLM so as to prevent the LLM from misbehaving.\n\n### Similarity Caching ⚡️\n\nCache the semantic representation of the prompt so as to reduce the number of prompt tokens and improve the overall inference latency.\n\n## Documentation 📖\n\nFor comprehensive documentation including detailed setup instructions, architecture guides, and API references, visit:\n\n**👉 [Complete Documentation at Read the Docs](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/)**\n\nThe documentation includes:\n\n- **[Installation Guide](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/docs/getting-started/installation/)** - Complete setup instructions\n- **[System Architecture](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/docs/architecture/system-architecture/)** - Technical deep dive\n- **[Model Training](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/docs/training/training-overview/)** - How classification models work\n- **[API Reference](https://vllm-semantic-router.com/docs/api/router/)** - Complete API documentation\n\n## Community 👋\n\nFor questions, feedback, or to contribute, please join `#semantic-router` channel in vLLM Slack.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find Semantic Router helpful in your research or projects, please consider citing it:\n\n```\n@misc{semanticrouter2025,\n  title={vLLM Semantic Router},\n  author={vLLM Semantic Router Team},\n  year={2025},\n  howpublished={\\url{https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router}},\n}\n```\n\n## Star History 🔥\n\nWe opened the project at Aug 31, 2025.

      "readme": "# 🤖 `cagent` 🤖\n\n> A powerful, easy to use, customizable multi-agent runtime that orchestrates AI agents with\n> specialized capabilities and tools, and the interactions between agents.\n\n![cagent in action](docs/assets/cagent-run.gif)\n\n## ✨ What is `cagent`? ✨\n\n`cagent` lets you create and run intelligent AI agents, where each agent has\nspecialized knowledge, tools, and capabilities.\n\nThink of it as allowing you to quickly build, share and run a team of virtual experts that\ncollaborate to solve complex problems for you.\n\nAnd it's dead easy to use!\n\n⚠️ Note: `cagent` is in active development, **breaking changes are to be expected** ⚠️\n\n### Your First Agent\n\nExample [basic_agent.yaml](/examples/basic_agent.yaml):\n\nCreating agents with cagent is very simple. They are described in a short yaml file, like this one:\n\n```yaml\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.\n```\n\nRun it in a terminal with `cagent run basic_agent.yaml`.\n\nMany more examples can be found [here](/examples/README.md)!\n\n### Improving an agent with MCP tools\n\n`cagent` supports MCP servers, enabling agents to use a wide variety of external tools and services.\n\nIt supports three transport types: `stdio`, `http` and `sse`.\n\nGiving an agent access to tools via MCP is a quick way to greatly improve its capabilities, the quality of its results and its general useful-ness.\n\nGet started quickly with the [Docker MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/) and [catalog](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/catalog/)\n\nHere, we're giving the same basic agent from the example above access to a **containerized** `duckduckgo` mcp server and it's tools by using Docker's MCP Gateway:\n\n```yaml\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.\n    toolset:\n      - type: mcp\n        ref: docker:duckduckgo # stdio transport\n```\n\nWhen using a containerized server via the Docker MCP gateway, you can configure any required settings/secrets/authentication using the [Docker MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/#example-use-the-github-official-mcp-server) in Docker Desktop.\n\nAside from the containerized MCP severs the Docker MCP Gateway provides, any standard MCP server can be used with cagent!\n\nHere's an example similar to the above but adding `read_file` and `write_file` tools from the `rust-mcp-filesystem` MCP server:\n\n```yaml\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses. Write your search results to disk.\n    toolset:\n      - type: mcp\n        ref: docker:duckduckgo\n      - type: mcp\n        command: rust-mcp-filesystem # installed with `cargo install rust-mcp-filesystem`\n        args: [\"--allow-write\", \".\"]\n        tools: [\"read_file\", \"write_file\"] # Optional: specific tools only\n        env:\n          - \"RUST_LOG=debug\"\n```\n\nSee [the USAGE docs](./docs/USAGE.md#tool-configuration) for more detailed information and examples\n\n### 🎯 Key Features\n\n- **🏗️ Multi-agent architecture** - Create specialized agents for different domains.\n- **🔧 Rich tool ecosystem** - Agents can use external tools and APIs via the MCP protocol.\n- **🔄 Smart delegation** - Agents can automatically route tasks to the most suitable specialist.\n- **📝 YAML configuration** - Declarative model and agent configuration.\n- **💭 Advanced reasoning** - Built-in \"think\", \"todo\" and \"memory\" tools for complex problem-solving.\n- **🌐 Multiple AI providers** - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and [Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/).\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start 🚀\n\n### Installation\n\n[Prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux can be found on the releases page of the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases)\n\nOnce you've downloaded the appropriate binary for your platform, you may need to give it executable permissions.\nOn macOS and Linux, this is done with the following command:\n\n```sh\n# linux amd64 build example\nchmod +x /path/to/downloads/cagent-linux-amd64\n```\n\nYou can then rename the binary to `cagent` and configure your `PATH` to be able to find it (configuration varies by platform).\n\n### **Set your API keys**\n\nBased on the models you configure your agents to use, you will need to set the corresponding provider API key accordingly,\nall theses keys are optional, you will likely need at least one of these, though:\n\n```bash\n# For OpenAI models\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=",

运营端部分演示\n1.商户管理\n​ 商户管理主要用来，创建商户，也就是开户，配置产品费率，以及配置产品对应跑的通道。\n\n1.1 商户列表\n![商户列表](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/3.png)\n\n\n\n1.2 应用列表\n![应用列表](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/4.png)\n\n1.2.3 产品列表\nimage\n\n产品配置通道（一个产品可以配置多个通道，这里就是运营人员需要重点关注的点）\n\n![产品列表](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/5.png)\n\n1.2.4 商户下单测试界面\n商户下单测试可以快速通过不同商户，选择不同的产品，以及不同的通道，来进行测试或者正式下单，可以帮助大家快速获取下单的结果。\n\n这里既可以针对商户对接，测试；也可以针对通道对接，测试。\n\n![6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/6.png)\n\n## 2.订单管理\n订单列表，可以实时查看当前系统订单情况。\n\n1.可以查看每个商户，每个产品，每个通道，商户费率，通道费率，平台成本，平台利润，支付状态，回调状态，补单状态等。\n\n![7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/7.png)\n\n2.打开实时统计，可以查看当前商户或产品或通道的统计情况\n\n![8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/8.png)\n\n3.当供应商已经明确支付成功（有时金额不对的情况下），但没有回调成功时，可以通过人工补单操作，此时可以在备注信息中说明情况。补单密码是跟系统分开的。补单并不会修改订单金额，只是会将系统订单状态从支付中，改为已支付。补单有些情况需要跟商户沟通，是否需要进行补单。补单的目的，除了改变系统状态之外，也会向商户发起回调通知。\n\n![9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/9.png)\n\n![10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/10.png)\n\n## 3.支付配置\n### 3.1 供应商管理\n​ 这里主要是用来对接通道的配置。开发这块的目的是为了：存在有优势的通道，需要我们去对接通道，但是，往往技术人员响应不及时，导致我们运营团队错失了很多赚钱的机会。那我们想：如果对接通道，不需要技术参与，我们运营人员能够自己对接，那该多好呀。在此应用场景下，供应商管理对接，就由此而生。 \n\n![11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/11.png)\n参数映射配置：\n\n第一步，供应商提供信息。包括（供应商开我们，开的户，密钥，下单地址，查单地址，等信息），具体还得看供应商的接口文档。 image 第二步：映射配置。包括下单、查单、回调，这三部分。下单包含，请求参数，返回参数配置；查单也一样，回调只有接收参数配置，而且每个配置都有说明。前期需要我们技术支持一下，带着一起配置几个通道方，以后运营人员就可以自己配置了。 \n\n![12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/12.png)\n![13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/13.png)\n![14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/14.png)\n![15](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/15.png)\n### 3.2 通道管理\n​ 上述通过供应商对接后，我们需要将供应商提供的通道信息添加进来即可。选择指定的供应商，供应商提供的通道编码、通道名称、通道费率、收款类型（分为固定额度只能是指定的额度，比如：30|50|100|200和浮动额度，区间范围比如：1-9999）、是否启用。这里加了一个回收站：主要是方便管理，只展示有用的通道。暂时不需要的可以进行回收操作，到回收站中的通道管理进行查看。 \n\n\n![16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/16.png)\n![17](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/17.png)\n### 3.3 产品管理\n​ 产品，在四方系统可以认为是一个大通道，我们给到商户的产品编码（也可以叫通道编码）和产品名称（也可以叫通道名称）。也就是对外推广和营销的大通道。这里由我们运营人员自定义一套产品（大通道）规则。\n​ 可以提前自定义好，产品编码（大通道编码）和产品名称（大通道名称）。 \n\n![18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/18.png)\n\n## 4.机器人管理\n### 4.1 配置机器人\n如果第一次接触TG机器人，需要到TG上注册一个机器人，获取token，进行设置，同时需要注册webhook方式，将机器人绑定到系统中去。请注意：如果是新部署的服务器域名必须要安装证书，也就是需要支持https\n\n![19](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/19.png)\n![20](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/20.png)\n![21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/21.png)\n\n### 4.2 群组管理\n这里的群组由运营人员，建好群后，并将机器人拉入群中，作为管理员权限，就会自动将群信息推送到后台系统中。如果运营人员通过命令绑定商户，就会自动关联群组。如果没有绑定，则显示暂未关联商户。同时，也可以自己建好群（频道）。建好群后，也可以添加群成员，设定权限。\n\n![22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/22.png)\n![23](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangpay/1/refs/heads/img/pay/23.png)\n\n### 4.3 消息管理\n这里可以新增消息，选择对应的群，进行转发\n\n![24](https://raw.gith",

Ship reliable agents that won't break in production.**\n\nShannon is battle-tested infrastructure for AI agents that solves the problems you'll hit at scale: runaway costs, non-deterministic failures, and security nightmares. Built on Temporal workflows and WASI sandboxing, it's the platform we wished existed when our LLM bills hit $50k/month.\n\n## 🔥 The Problems We Solve\n\n- **\"Our AI costs are out of control\"** → 70% token reduction via intelligent caching\n- **\"We can't debug production issues\"** → Deterministic replay of any workflow\n- **\"Agents keep breaking randomly\"** → Time-travel debugging with full state history\n- **\"We're worried about prompt injection\"** → WASI sandbox + OPA policies for bulletproof security\n- **\"Different teams need different models\"** → Hot-swap between 15+ LLM providers\n- **\"We need audit trails for compliance\"** → Every decision logged and traceable\n\n## ⚡ What Makes Shannon Different\n\n### 🚀 Ship Faster\n- **Zero Configuration Multi-Agent** - Just describe what you want: \"Analyze data, then create report\" → Shannon handles dependencies automatically\n- **Multiple AI Patterns** - ReAct, Tree-of-Thoughts, Chain-of-Thought, Debate, and Reflection (configurable via `cognitive_strategy`)\n- **Time-Travel Debugging** - Export and replay any workflow to reproduce exact agent behavior\n- **Hot Configuration** - Change models, prompts, and policies without restarts\n\n### 🔒 Production Ready\n- **WASI Sandbox** - Full Python 3.11 support with bulletproof security ([→ Guide](docs/python-code-execution.md))\n- **Token Budget Control** - Hard limits per user/session with real-time tracking\n- **Policy Engine (OPA)** - Define who can use which tools, models, and data\n- **Multi-Tenancy** - Complete isolation between users, sessions, and organizations\n\n### 📈 Scale Without Breaking\n- **70% Cost Reduction** - Smart caching, session management, and token optimization\n- **Provider Agnostic** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, Bedrock, DeepSeek, Groq, and more\n- **Observable by Default** - Real-time dashboard, Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing\n- **Distributed by Design** - Horizontal scaling with Temporal workflow orchestration\n\n*Model pricing is centralized in `config/models.yaml` - all services load from this single source for consistent cost tracking.*\n\n## 🎯 Why Shannon vs. Others?\n\n| Challenge | Shannon | LangGraph | AutoGen | CrewAI |\n|---------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| **Multi-Agent Orchestration** | ✅ DAG/Graph workflows | ✅ Stateful graphs | ✅ Group chat | ✅ Crew/roles |\n| **Agent Communication** | ✅ Message passing | ✅ Tool calling | ✅ Conversations | ✅ Delegation |\n| **Memory & Context** | ✅ Long/short-term, vector | ✅ Multiple types | ✅ Conversation history | ✅ Shared memory |\n| **Debugging Production Issues** | ✅ Replay any workflow | ❌ Limited debugging | ❌ Basic logging | ❌ |\n| **Token Cost Control** | ✅ Hard budget limits | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Security Sandbox** | ✅ WASI isolation | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Policy Control (OPA)** | ✅ Fine-grained rules | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Deterministic Replay** | ✅ Time-travel debugging | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Session Persistence** | ✅ Redis-backed, durable | ⚠️ In-memory only | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ |\n| **Multi-Language** | ✅ Go/Rust/Python | ⚠️ Python only | ⚠️ Python only | ⚠️ Python only |\n| **Production Metrics** | ✅ Dashboard/Prometheus | ⚠️ DIY | ❌ | ❌ |\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Docker and Docker Compose\n- Make, curl, grpcurl\n- An API key for at least one supported LLM provider\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Docker Setup Instructions</b> (click to expand)</summary>\n\n#### Installin",

      "readme": "This is the second part of a series introducing Bash programmers to Go. This part is about basics of writing CLI tools in Go. See the [first](https://github.com/go-monk/from-bash-to-go-part-i) part for the language building blocks.\n\n# Our first CLI tool\n\nBash is often used to write small CLI tools and automation. Let's start with an example CLI tool that prints \"hello\" to terminal. The Bash version is pretty simple:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\necho hello\n```\n\nNow, let's implement a Go version. We start by creating a directory where the first version of our program will live. We also initialize a module in there:\n\n```sh\n$ mkdir -p hello/1\n$ cd hello/1\n$ go mod init hello\n```\n\nSince the program is not complex we don't have to think a lot about its design and can easily start with a test:\n\n```go\n// hello/1/hello_test.go\npackage hello_test\n\nimport (\n\t\"hello\"\n\t\"testing\"\n)\n\nfunc TestPrintExists(t *testing.T) {\n\thello.Print()\n}\n```\n\nWe named the package `hello_test` instead of `hello`. This is possible and it allows for writing tests that use only the public API (identifiers starting with a capital letter) of the tested package as a real user would. Note that `*_test` packages are the sole exception to Go's standard rule that each source directory can contain only one package. In this test we just call the `Print` function from the `hello` package. Let's try and run the test:\n\n```sh\n$ go test\nhello: no non-test Go files in ~/github.com/go-monk/from-bash-to-go-series/part-ii-cli-tools/hello/1\nFAIL    hello [build failed]\n```\n\nYes, we have not yet written the code we want to test. So let's do it:\n\n```go\n// hello/1/hello.go\npackage hello\n\nfunc Print() {}\n```\n\nIf we re-run the test\n\n```sh\n$ go test\nPASS\nok      hello   0.570s\n```\n\nwe can see that all is good now. Or is it? Well, something must be wrong because an empty function that does nothing at all (except that it exists) passes the test. So the *test* is obviously wrong. Now we need to start thinking a bit. What should be actually tested? \n\n## Making it testable\n\nOkay, we want the function to print the string \"hello\" to terminal. How to test it except by looking at the terminal? In Bash the terminal is the standard output, i.e. the place where the stuff is written to by default. But we can redirect the standard output to a file or store it in a variable:\n\n```bash\n$ echo hello > /tmp/hello.txt\n$ HELLO=$(echo hello)\n```\n\nIn Go you can achieve similar functionality by using the standard library interface called [io.Writer](https://pkg.go.dev/io#Writer) (that is the `Writer` from the `io` package):\n\n```go\n// hello/2/hello.go\nfunc PrintTo(w io.Writer) {\n\ts := \"hello\"\n\tw.Write([]byte(s))\n}\n```\n\nWe write (print) the string \"hello\" to `w` supplied as the function's argument. And since the argument (parameter more precisely) is an interface it can be multiple kinds of things. Or more precisely it can be any type that implements the `io.Writer` interface, i.e. has a function with the `Write(p []byte) (int, error)` signature attached.\n\nThere are many implementations of `io.Writer` in the standard library. Two of them are `bytes.Buffer` and `os.Stdout`. We can write to a bytes buffer in the test\n\n```go\n// hello/2/hello_test.go\nfunc TestPrintToPrintsHelloToWriter(t *testing.T) {\n\tbuf := new(bytes.Buffer)\n\thello.PrintTo(buf) // writing to buffer\n\twant := \"hello\"\n\tgot := buf.String()\n\tif want != got {\n\t\tt.Errorf(\"want %q, got %q\", want, got)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nand to the standard output in the main function\n\n```go\n// hello/2/cmd/hello/main.go\nfunc main() {\n\thello.PrintTo(os.Stdout) // writing to STDOUT\n}\n```\n\nNow we have a real test that we can rely on:\n\n```sh\n$ cd hello/2\n$ go test\nPASS\nok      hello   0.183s\n```\n\nAs an exercise try to break the test so it doesn't pass.\n\nWe also added the `cmd` folder that holds the binary (command) to be used by the end user like this:\n\n```sh\n$ go install ./cmd/hello\n$ hello\nhello\n```\n\n## Decreasing complexity\n\nTalking about the end user and looking at how the `PrintTo` function is called in `main`\n\n```go\nhello.PrintTo(os.Stdout)\n```\n\nwe might think this is not ideal. Why should a user tell the function to print to standard output? Isn't it what most users want most of the time? Shouldn't it be the default behavior?\n\n### Nil argument\n\nBut the `PrintTo` function *must* have an argument when called. So maybe we can use the approach that's used by the `http.ListenAndServe` standard library function; we use `nil` to indicate we want the default behaviour:\n\n```go\n// hello/3/hello.go\nfunc PrintTo(w io.Writer) {\n\tif w == nil {\n\t\tw = os.Stdout\n\t}\n\ts := \"hello\"\n\tw.Write([]byte(s))\n}\n```\n\n```go\n// hello/3/cmd/hello/main.go\nhello.PrintTo(nil)\n```\n\nHmm, this works but still seems unnecessary complex.\n\n### Global variable\n\nWe could remove the need for an argument altogether by using a global variable that would define where to write:\n\n```go\n// hello/4/hello.go\nvar Output io.Writer = os.Stdout\n```\n\nTo change the default, you change the global variable:\n\n```go\n// hello/4/h",

It is currently in active development and **not intended for production use**. We plan to release a production-ready version in the future. Use at your own risk and always test in development environments first.\n\n<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n  <img alt=\"AI Infrastructure Agent\" src=\"docs/images/ai-infrastructure-agent.svg\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\">\n</h1>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.24.2+-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go)](https://golang.org/)\n[![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/AWS-Cloud-FF9900?style=for-the-badge&logo=amazon-aws)](https://aws.amazon.com/)\n[![MCP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-MCP-purple?style=for-the-badge)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n\n*Intelligent AWS infrastructure management through natural language interactions*\n\n</div>\n\n## What is AI Infrastructure Agent?\n\nAI Infrastructure Agent is an intelligent system that allows you to manage AWS infrastructure using natural language commands. Powered by advanced AI models (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude), it translates your infrastructure requests into executable AWS operations while maintaining safety through conflict detection and resolution.\n\n<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n  <img alt=\"Web Dashboard\" src=\"docs/images/web-dashboard.svg\">\n</h1>\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Natural Language Interface** - Describe what you want, not how to build it\n- **Multi-AI Provider Support** - Choose between OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, or AWS Bedrock Nova\n- **Web Dashboard** - Visual interface for infrastructure management, built-in conflict detection and dry-run mode\n- **Terraform-like state** - Maintains accurate infrastructure state\n- **Current Resource Support** - VPC, EC2, SG, Autoscaling Group, ALB. Check the roadmap here: [Core Platform Development](https://github.com/orgs/VersusControl/projects/19)\n\n## Example Usage\n\nImagine you want to create AWS infrastructure with a simple request:\n\n> **\"Create an EC2 instance for hosting an Apache Server with a dedicated security group that allows inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.\"**\n\n> 💡 **Amazon Nova Users**: When using AWS Bedrock Nova models, you may want to specify the region in your request for better context, e.g., *\"Create an EC2 instance in us-east-1 for hosting an Apache Server...\"*\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n### 1. AI Analysis & Planning\n\nThe AI agent analyzes your request and creates a detailed execution plan:\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant A as AI Agent\n    participant S as State Manager\n    participant M as MCP Server\n    participant AWS as AWS APIs\n    \n    U->>A: \"Create EC2 instance for Apache Server...\"\n    A->>S: Get current infrastructure state\n    S->>A: Return current state\n    A->>M: Query available tools & capabilities\n    M->>A: Return tool capabilities\n    A->>A: Generate execution plan with LLM\n    A->>AWS: Validate plan (dry-run checks)\n    AWS->>A: Validation results\n    A->>U: Present execution plan for approval\n    \n    Note over A,U: Plan includes:<br/>• Get Default VPC<br/>• Create Security Group<br/>• Add HTTP & SSH rules<br/>• Get Latest AMI<br/>• Create EC2 Instance\n```\n\nThe agent presents the plan for your review:\n- Shows exactly what will be created\n- Waits for your approval\n\n### 2. Execution & Monitoring\n\nOnce approved, the agent:\n- Creates resources in the correct order\n- Monitors progress in real-time\n- Handles dependencies automatically\n- Reports completion status\n\n<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"border-bottom: none\">\n  <img alt=\"Execution & Monitoring\" src=\"docs/images/simple-demo.svg\">\n</h1>\n\n### 3.

      "readme": "This is the first part of a series introducing Bash programmers to Go. This part goes through the language building blocks that will be used in later parts.\n\n# Ok but why?\n\n> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing. - Alan J. Perlis\n\nYou might be wondering along these lines - I already kind of know Bash (or a similar language) and can do all I need in it. It's easy and fast. Why should I learn Go? That's a good question. Always ask why because the answer to a why question provides a reason and thus understanding and motivation. In our case I think the answer has to do with the difference between programming and software engineering.\n\nProgramming means writing a program that works and does something useful. Software engineering is programming plus time and other people. It's the initial writing of a program and its being modified by you or other people over time. Programming alone is hard enough. First you need to understand the domain and the concrete problem to solve within the domain. Then you design a solution and implement it in a programming language whose syntax and idioms you should know well. This process can, and *should*, take multiple iterations. When you are done you go work on other stuff. Then you might be asked to modify something in the program (to fix a bug or add new functionality) or to hand over the program to someone else (people come and go).\n\nThe most important thing to do when doing the software engineering is to reduce the cognitive load; to reduce the system's complexity. This requires hard work, attention to detail and using good tools. I think Go is a good tool for software engineering because it includes \"a cultural agenda of radical simplicity\". See https://github.com/go-monk/from-bash-to-go for a practical example of how and why migrate a script from Bash to Go.\n\n# Building blocks\n\nIn this section I swiftly introduce some of the language building blocks that I hope will help you start understanding the Go syntax, semantics and idioms. I recommend actually writing (copying) the code below in your favorite editor. And then running it. And maybe changing it a bit and running again. If you break the code be happy, that's a way to learn :-).\n\n## Writing and running Go code\n\nPackages are Go's way of organizing and (re)using code.\n\nBash is organized mostly via files - each program usually lives in a file:\n\n```\n+------------+\n| script1.sh |\n+------------+\n+------------+\n| script2.sh |\n+------------+\n+------------+\n| script3.sh |\n+------------+\n```\n\nGo code lives in one or more *packages* that are contained in one or more .go files within a single directory. Packages can be grouped into *modules* for versioning and sharing.\n\nIt can be visualized like this:\n\n```\n+--------------------------+\n| module example.net/hello |\n|                          |\n|  +-------------------+   |\n|  |   package main    |   |\n|  |                   |   |\n|  |  +-------------+  |   |\n|  |  | greeting.go |  |   |\n|  |  +-------------+  |   |\n|  |  +-------------+  |   |\n|  |  | hello.go    |  |   |\n|  |  +-------------+  |   |\n|  |                   |   |\n|  +-------------------+   |\n|                          |\n+--------------------------+\n```\n\nGo identifiers - constants, variables, types and functions - are visible (exported) outside of a package when their name starts with an uppercase letter. Otherwise they are confined to the current package.\n\nLet's create our first package. In case you want to run your code (as opposed to using it as an importable library) you need at least the `main` package.\n\nFirst create a directory and change to it:\n\n```\n$ mkdir hello\n$ cd hello\n```\n\nThen create `hello.go` file with the following content:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(\"hello\")\n}\n```\n\nThe `main` function is where the program's execution starts.\n\nThe easiest way to run a Go program is:\n\n```sh\n$ go run hello.go # build the binary and run it\nhello\n```\n\nAs mentioned above, you can spread package code into multiple files within the same directory:\n\n```go\n// hello.go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n        fmt.Println(greeting)\n}\n```\n\n```go\n// greeting.go\npackage main\n\nconst greeting = \"hello\"\n```\n\nNow we need to include both package files:\n\n```sh\n$ go run hello.go greeting.go\nhello\n```\n\nModule is a group of packages that is versioned as a unit. To create a module:\n\n```sh\n$ go mod init github.com/jsmith/hello\n$ go mod tidy # download dependencies\n```\n\nTo build for a different OS and/or CPU architecture than the one you are running:\n\n```sh\nmacOS$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build\n```\n\nTo see the list of all supported OS/ARCH combinations:\n\n```sh\n$ go tool dist list\n```\n\nSee https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started for more.\n\n## Variables and types\n\nIn Bash all simple variables are strings:\n\n```sh\nname=Jack\nage=40\nactive=true\n\n# this is not a problem in Bash, since there are no types\nage=forty\n```\n\nGo is a statically typed language.

      "readme": "# FrankenPHP gRPC Server\n\nA [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev) extension that allows you to run a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server triggering code written either in PHP or Go.\nUnder the hood, this extension uses the [gRPC for Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/) library and FrankenPHP's [Go extension support](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/extensions/).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> This extension is highly experimental and not recommended for production use.\n> The public API may change at any time without notice.\n\n## Features\n\n* Run a high performance gRPC server with FrankenPHP (the PHP part is executed in a worker loop)\n* Write gRPC service handlers in PHP\n* Write gRPC service handlers in Go\n* Write gRPC service handlers in a mix of PHP and Go 🤯\n* All features supported by the [gRPC for Go](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/) library\n* Entirely written in Go, no C code!\n* [API Platform](https://api-platform.com) compatibility!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n* FrankenPHP extensions prerequisites: https://frankenphp.dev/docs/extensions/#prerequisites\n* gRPC for Go prerequisites: https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/#prerequisites\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a Go module\n\n```console\ngo mod init example.com/mygrpcserver \n```\n\n### Create a Protobuf Definition:\n\nCreate a `.proto` file describing your gRPC service and messages.\n\nExample (in a `helloworld/helloworld.proto` file):\n\n```protobuf\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\noption go_package = \"example.com/mygrpcserver/helloworld\";\n\npackage helloworld;\n\nservice Greeter {\n  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}\n}\n\nmessage HelloRequest {\n  string name = 1;\n}\n\nmessage HelloReply {\n  string message = 1;\n}\n```\n\nGenerate the Go code:\n\n```console\nprotoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative helloworld/helloworld.proto\n```\n\n### Implement the gRPC Server in Go\n\n```go\npackage mygrpcserver\n\nimport (\n\t\"context\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\n\tpb \"example.com/mygrpcserver/helloworld\"\n\t\"github.com/dunglas/frankenphp\"\n\tphpGrpc \"github.com/dunglas/frankenphp-grpc\"\n\t\"github.com/go-viper/mapstructure/v2\"\n\t\"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n\t\"google.golang.org/grpc/reflection\"\n)\n\nfunc init() {\n\tphpGrpc.RegisterGrpcServerFactory(func() *grpc.Server {\n\t\ts := grpc.NewServer()\n\t\tpb.RegisterGreeterServer(s, &server{})\n\t\treflection.Register(s)\n\n\t\treturn s\n\t})\n}\n\ntype server struct {\n\tpb.UnimplementedGreeterServer\n}\n\n// SayHello implements helloworld.GreeterServer\nfunc (s *server) SayHello(_ context.Context, in *pb.HelloRequest) (*pb.HelloReply, error) {\n\tif in.Name == \"\" {\n\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"the Name field is required\")\n\t}\n\n    // Convert the request to a map[string]any\n\tvar phpRequest map[string]any\n\tif err := mapstructure.Decode(in, &phpRequest); err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\n    // Call the PHP code, pass the map as a PHP associative array\n\tphpResponse := phpGrpc.HandleRequest(phpRequest)\n\n    // Convert the PHP response (a map) back to a HelloReply struct\n\tvar response pb.HelloReply\n\tif err := mapstructure.Decode(phpResponse.(frankenphp.AssociativeArray).Map, &response); err != nil {\n\t\treturn nil, err\n\t}\n\n\treturn &response, nil\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the [gRPC for Go documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/) for more details on how to implement your gRPC service in Go.\nRfer to the [FrankenPHP extensions documentation](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/extensions/) for more details on how to pass data from Go to PHP and vice versa.\n\n### Implement the gRPC Service Handler in PHP\n\nCreate a file named `grpc-worker.php` in the same directory as the FrankenPHP binary we'll build later:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// Require the Composer autoloader here if needed (API Platform, Symfony, etc.)\n//require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// Handler outside the loop for better performance (doing less work)\n$handler = static function (array $request): array  {\n\t// Do something with the gRPC request\n\n    return ['message' => \"Hello, {$request['Name']}\"];\n};\n\n$maxRequests = (int)($_SERVER['MAX_REQUESTS'] ?? 0);\nfor ($nbRequests = 0; !$maxRequests || $nbRequests < $maxRequests; ++$nbRequests) {\n    $keepRunning = \\frankenphp_handle_request($handler);\n\n    // Call the garbage collector to reduce the chances of it being triggered in the middle of the handling of a request\n    gc_collect_cycles();\n\n    if (!$keepRunning) {\n      break;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Create the `Caddyfile`\n\nCreate a `Caddyfile` in the same directory as the FrankenPHP binary we'll build later:\n\n```caddyfile\n{\n\tfrankenphp\n\tgrpc {\n\t\taddress :50051 # Optional\n\t\tworker grpc-worker.php # Optional\n\t\tmin_threads 50 # Optional, defaults to runtime.NumCPU()\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Build and Run the FrankenPHP Binary with the gRPC Extension\n\nRun the server:\n\n```console\nXCADDY_DEBUG=1\n    CGO_ENABLED=1 \\\n\tXCADDY_GO_BUILD_FLAGS=\"-tags=nobadger,nomysql,nopgx\" \\\n\tCGO_CFLAGS=\"$(php-config --includes) -I/opt/homebrew/include/\" \\\n\tCGO_LDFLAGS=\"$(php-config --ldflags) $(php-config --libs) -L/opt/homebrew/lib/ -L/usr/lib\" \\\n\txcaddy build\n\n./caddy run\n```\n\nYour ",
