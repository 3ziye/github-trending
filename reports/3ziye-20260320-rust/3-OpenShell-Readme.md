OpenShell is the safe, private runtime for autonomous AI agents. It provides sandboxed execution environments that protect your data, credentials, and infrastructure — governed by declarative YAML policies that prevent unauthorized file access, data exfiltration, and uncontrolled network activity.

OpenShell is built agent-first. The project ships with agent skills for everything from cluster debugging to policy generation, and we expect contributors to use them.

> **Alpha software — single-player mode.** OpenShell is proof-of-life: one developer, one environment, one gateway. We are building toward multi-tenant enterprise deployments, but the starting point is getting your own environment up and running. Expect rough edges. Bring your agent.

## Quickstart


### Prerequisites

- **Docker** — Docker Desktop (or a Docker daemon) must be running.

### Install

**Binary (recommended):**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/main/install.sh | sh
```

**From PyPI (requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):**

```bash
uv tool install -U openshell
```

### Create a sandbox

```bash
openshell sandbox create -- claude  # or opencode, codex, ollama
```

A gateway is created automatically on first use. To deploy on a remote host instead, pass `--remote user@host` to the create command.

The sandbox container includes the following tools by default:

| Category   | Tools                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Agent      | `claude`, `opencode`, `codex`                            |
| Language   | `python` (3.13), `node` (22)                             |
| Developer  | `gh`, `git`, `vim`, `nano`                               |
| Networking | `ping`, `dig`, `nslookup`, `nc`, `traceroute`, `netstat` |

### See network policy in action

Every sandbox starts with **minimal outbound access**. You open additional access with a short YAML policy that the proxy enforces at the HTTP method and path level, without restarting anything.

```bash
# 1. Create a sandbox (starts with minimal outbound access)
openshell sandbox create

# 2. Inside the sandbox — blocked
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
curl: (56) Received HTTP code 403 from proxy after CONNECT

# 3. Back on the host — apply a read-only GitHub API policy
sandbox$ exit
openshell policy set demo --policy examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/policy.yaml --wait

# 4. Reconnect — GET allowed, POST blocked by L7
openshell sandbox connect demo
sandbox$ curl -sS https://api.github.com/zen
Anything added dilutes everything else.

sandbox$ curl -sS -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/hello-world/issues -d '{"title":"oops"}'
{"error":"policy_denied","detail":"POST /repos/octocat/hello-world/issues not permitted by policy"}
```

```bash
bash examples/sandbox-policy-quickstart/demo.sh
```

## How It Works

OpenShell isolates each sandbox in its own container with policy-enforced egress routing. A lightweight gateway coordinates sandbox lifecycle, and every outbound connection is intercepted by the policy engine, which does one of three things:

- **Allows** — the destination and binary match a policy block.
- **Routes for inference** — strips caller credentials, injects backend credentials, and forwards to the managed model.
- **Denies** — blocks the request and logs it.

| Component          | Role                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gateway**        | Control-plane API that coordinates sandbox lifecycle and acts as the auth boundary.          |
| **Sandbox**        | Isolated runtime with container supervision and policy-enforced egress routing.              |
| **Policy Engine**  | Enforces filesystem, network, and process constraints from application layer down to kernel. |
| **Privacy Router** | Privacy-aware LLM routing that keeps sensitive context on sandbox compute.                   |

Under the hood, all these components run as a [K3s](https://k3s.io/) Kubernetes cluster inside a
