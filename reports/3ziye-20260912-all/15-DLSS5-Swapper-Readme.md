## Features

- **Easy installation:** native DLSS games, or compatible non-DLSS games through DLSS5-Feeder.
- **Your library:** Steam, Epic, GOG, modern Xbox Game Pass folders, and manually added games/emulators.
- **Search and filters:** combine title, graphics API, DLSS status/version and add-ons; click counters to filter.
- **Flexible layout:** group by store or show everything in one list, with game artwork and light/dark themes.
- **Controlled scanning:** full-drive scanning is **off by default**. Added folders still scan normally; enable all-drive discovery or remove scan folders in Settings.
- **Right-click shortcuts:** open/copy folder, rescan, change cover, restore originals or hide a game.
- **Backups and History:** restore original files, keep installation records, and copy History/activity/install logs.
- **Save diagnostics:** one file with the install log, the game’s own ReShade and Feeder logs, the manifest and your driver - shown to you before it is written, and ready to attach to a report.
- **In-game overlay:** press **F8** to open the app's own panel over the running game and move the real DLSS Neural Rendering sliders while you play. Supports the **DLSS5-Feeder** and **RenoDX v4.7** routes only. Drag the grip in its bottom right corner to resize it; each game remembers its own size.
- **Rendering API override:** optional, per game, with **Automatic** as the default; detection is never overwritten.
- **Custom add-ons:** the Add-ons page remains available alongside the integrated installation routes.
- **Multipass neural rendering:** an installation route that runs the neural pass up to ten times per frame, on DX12, DX11 and 64-bit DX9 - including games with no DLSS of their own.
- **Community (BETA):** read what worked for other people on the games you own, leave your own report, and talk it over underneath it. Opt-in, and everything you leave can be edited, deleted or withdrawn.
- **Community chat:** one live room for everyone using the app - screenshots, game cards, replies with mentions and reactions.

## New in 2.2.6

Community chat, and the fault 2.2.5 shipped in every native install - fixed at the cause.

### 💬 Community chat

One live room for everyone using the app, on its own page under **Games**.

- **Screenshots in the conversation.** Paste, drop or pick up to four images. They are compressed on your machine before they leave it, and they expire after 24 hours. Tag one **DLSS 5 ON** or **DLSS 5 OFF** and a comparison reads without explaining it.
- **Game cards.** Attach any game from the Community page: its result and its report count travel with the message, and a click opens its reports in place.
- **Replies with mentions, reactions,** and your own messages to edit or delete. Any image can be saved to disk.
- **Live.** New messages arrive while you read, an unread count waits on the sidebar while you are elsewhere, and a half-written message survives leaving the page.

It uses the community name you chose in Settings.

### And four things that were wrong

| | |
|---|---|
| **Native DLSS (RenoDX) installed the multipass consumer** | The native route's add-on was picked as "the first `.addon64` in the folder", and once the multipass build shipped beside the ordinary one it sorted first. It is chosen by name now, in the app and in the build |
| **Two RenoDX consumers
