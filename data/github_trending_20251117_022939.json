We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.\n\n**Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity.** Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges. \n\n## Quick Example\n\nA basic Valdi component:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends Component {\n  onRender() {\n    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';\n    <view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}>\n      <label color='black' value={message} />\n    </view>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./docs/docs/assets/start-about/IMG_1445.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Hello World example running on iOS\" />\n</p>\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](./docs/INSTALL.md)\n- [Documentation](./docs/README.md)\n- [Codelabs](./docs/docs/start-code-lab.md)\n- [API Reference](./docs/api/api-quick-reference.md)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](./docs/docs/faq.md)\n- [Component Library](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi_Widgets)\n\n## Why Choose Valdi?\n\nValdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.\n\n### True Native Performance\n\nUnlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:\n\n- **[Automatic view recycling](./docs/docs/performance-view-recycling.md)** - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency\n- **Optimized component rendering** - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates\n- **Optimized layout engine** - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead\n- **Viewport-aware rendering** - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default\n\nLearn more in our [Performance Optimization Guide](./docs/docs/performance-optimization.md).\n\n### Developer Experience Built for Speed\n\nValdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:\n\n- **Instant hot reload** - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling\n- **[Full VSCode debugging](./docs/docs/workflow-hermes-debugger.md)** - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode\n- **Familiar syntax** - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety\n\n### Flexible Adoption Model\n\nValdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:\n\n- **[Embed Valdi in native](./docs/docs/native-bindings.md)** - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies\n- **[Embed native in Valdi](./docs/docs/native-customviews.md)** - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via `<custom-view>`\n- **[Polyglot modules](./docs/docs/native-polyglot.md)** - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript\n- **[Full-stack architecture](./docs/docs/advanced-full-stack.md)** - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code\n\n### Deep Native Integration\n\nValdi generates type-safe bindings between TypeScript and native platforms:\n\n- **[Automatic code generation](./docs/docs/native-annotations.md)** - TypeScript interfaces compile to Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift bindings\n- **[Native API access](./docs/docs/native-polyglot.md)** - Direct access to platform APIs and third-party native libraries through polyglot modules\n- **Bidirectional communication** - Pass complex data structures and callbacks between TypeScript and native code safely\n- **[Native protobuf support](./docs/docs/advanced-protobuf.md)** - Seamless integration ",

[(docs)](#initialize-the-godot-instance)\n* When restarting, the engine can be reconfigured, so a different Godot app may be loaded each time. [(docs)](#stop-the-godot-instance)\n* It is also possible to pause and resume the running Godot instance. [(docs)](#pause-the-godot-instance)\n* Godot is running on a separate thread, so it does not affect the main thread of the application nor the React Native JavaScript thread. [(docs)](#threading-and-javascript-in-react-native)\n* The Godot main window and any subwindows created by the Godot app may be embedded into the React Native application either on the same screen, or on separate screens (see [example app](example/)).\n* The whole Godot API is accessible from TypeScript / JavaScript. It is possible to instantiate objects, call methods, get and set properties, attach JS functions to signals, provide JS functions as callables to Godot methods ... etc. [(docs)](#godot-api-usage)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33266f05-d733-4c1d-ab49-edaaf426e3e1\" width=\"600\" controls></video>\n</p>\n\n# Getting Started with the Example App\n\nThe [example app](example/) shows the main features of React Native Godot in action.\n\n## Install Prerequisites\n\nDuring development we use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage most external dependencies required for React Native development, like Node, Java, Gradle or Ruby. If you also use ASDF, just run:\n\n```sh\nasdf install\n```\n    \nThis will make sure that all the dependencies are the same like in our environment. Otherwise you may also install React Native prerequisites using any other method.\n\n## Export the Godot app\n\nRun the following scripts for either platform you plan to test (or both):\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh ios\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh ios\n```\n\nThe script is configured to look for Godot in the standard system wide installation folder on macOS. If your Godot is installed elsewhere, or you are on Linux, just point the `GODOT_EDITOR`\nenvironment variable to your Godot editor prior to running the above scripts:\n\n```sh\nexport GODOT_EDITOR=/path/to/godot_editor\n```\n\n## Configure and download LibGodot\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThese commands will resolve all the React Native and other dependencies from npm. The second one will download the prebuilt LibGodot release from GitHub.\n\n## Run on the iOS Simulator\n\n```sh\ncd example/ios\nbundle install\nbundle exec pod install\ncd ..\nyarn ios\n```\n\n## Run on the Android Emulator\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn android\n```\n\n## Use your native IDEs\n\nYou may use Xcode and Android Studio the same way as with any other project. Just open:\n\n* ``ios/GodotTest.xcworkspace`` from Xcode\n* ``android`` from Android Studio\n\n> [!note]\n> If you are using ASDF to manage your Java and Node dependencies, you should start Android Studio from under the `react-native-godot` (or `example`) folder, so it can find these tools. For example on macOS:\n\n```sh\ncd example\nopen -a \"Android Studio\"\n```\n\n## Convenience script for dependency management\n\nThere is an `update_deps.sh` script included in the example app's folder. It will execute all the setup commands for both iOS and Android in one step, so you may start your work immediately.\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./update_deps.sh\nyarn ios # or yarn android\n```\n\n# Your first React Native Godot App\n\nBorn React Native Godot is distributed on npm.\n\nJust follow these steps to add it to your React Native application:\n\n## Update `package.json`\n\n```sh\nyarn add @borndotcom/react-native-godot\n```\n\n## Download the prebuilt LibGodot packages\n\nThe LibGodot packages used by React Native Godot are not distributed on npm. Instead, they are downloaded separately by issuing the following command:\n\n```sh\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThis way React Native Godot can be updated independently from LibGodot, and also local, customized builds of LibGodot are supported.\n\n## Import React Native Godot in your App code\n\n```typescript\nimport { RTNGodot, RTNGodotView, runOnGodotThread } from \"@borndotcom/react-native-godot\";\n```\n\n## Add the Godot View to your view, e.g.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <RTNGodotView style={...}/>\n    </View>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIf no `windowName` property is specified, that view is fo",

      "readme": "# Lightning-LM\n\nLightning-Speed Lidar Localization and Mapping\n\nLightning-LM is a complete laser mapping and localization module.\n\nFeatures of Lightning-LM:\n\n1. [done] Complete 3D Lidar SLAM, fast LIO front-end (AA-FasterLIO), standard\n2. [done] 3D to 2D map conversion (g2p5), optional, if selected outputs real-time 2D grid map, can be saved\n3. [done] Real-time loop closure detection, standard, performs back-end loop closure detection and correction if\n   selected\n4. [done] Smooth high-precision 3D Lidar localization, standard\n5. [done] Dynamic loading scheme for map partitions, suitable for large-scale scenes\n6. [done] Localization with separate dynamic and static layers, adaptable to dynamic scenes, selectable strategies for\n   dynamic layer, optional, if selected saves dynamic layer map content, three strategies available (short-term,\n   medium-term, permanent), default is permanent\n7. [done] High-frequency IMU smooth output, standard, 100Hz\n8. GPS geoinformation association, optional (TODO)\n9. Vehicle odometry input, optional (TODO)\n10. [done] Lightweight optimization library miao and incremental optimization (derived from g2o, but lighter and faster,\n    supports incremental optimization, no need to rebuild optimization model), standard, used in both loop closure and\n    localization\n11. [done] Two verification schemes: offline and online. Offline allows breakpoint debugging with strong consistency.\n    Online allows multi-threaded concurrency, fast processing speed, dynamic frame skipping, and low resource usage.\n12. [done] High-frequency output based on extrapolator and smoother, adjustable smoothing factor\n13. [done] High-performance computing: All the above features can run using less than one CPU core on the pure CPU\n    side (online localization 0.8 cores, mapping 1.2 cores, 32-line LiDAR, without UI).\n\n## Updates\n\n1. 2025.11.13\n\n- Fix two logic typos in FasterLIO.\n- Add global height constraint that can be configured in loop_closing.with_height. If set true, lightning-lm will keep\n  the output map into the same height to avoid the Z-axis drifting in large scenes. It should not be set if you are\n  using lightning-lm in scenes that have multi-floor or stairs structures.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Mapping on the VBR campus dataset:\n\n<video controls width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"doc/slam_vbr.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n- Localization on VBR\n\n<video controls width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"doc/lm_loc_vbr_campus.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n- Map on VBR\n    - Point Cloud\n\n  ![](./doc/campus_vbr.png)\n    - Grid Map\n\n  ![](./doc/campus.png)\n\n- Localization on the NCLT dataset\n\n<video controls width=\"100%\">\n  <source src=\"doc/lm_loc1_nclt.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n## Build\n\n### Environment\n\nUbuntu 22.04 or higher.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 should also work, but not tested.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- ros2 humble or above\n- Pangolin (for visualization, see thirdparty)\n- OpenCV\n- PCL\n- yaml-cpp\n- glog\n- gflags\n- pcl_conversions\n\nOn Ubuntu 22.04, run: ```bash ./scripts/install_dep.sh```.\n\n### Build\n\nBuild this package with ```colcon build```.\n\nThen ```source install/setup.bash``` to use it.\n\n### Build Results\n\nAfter building, you will get the corresponding online/offline mapping and localization programs for this package. The\noffline programs are suitable for scenarios with offline data packets to quickly obtain mapping/localization results,\nwhile the online programs are suitable for scenarios with actual sensors to obtain real-time results.\n\nFor example, calling the offline mapping program on the NCLT dataset:\n```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --input_bag ~/data/NCLT/20130110/20130110.db3 --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n\nIf you want to call the online version, just change the offline part to online.\n\n## Testing on Datasets\n\nYou can directly use our converted datasets. If you need the original datasets, you need to convert them to the ros2 db3\nformat.\n\nConverted dataset addresses:\n\n- OneDrive: https://1drv.ms/f/c/1a7361d22c554503/EpDSys0bWbxDhNGDYL_O0hUBa2OnhNRvNo2Gey2id7QMQA?e=7Ui0f5\n- BaiduYun:\n\nOriginal dataset addresses:\n\n- NCLT dataset: http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/\n- UrbanLoco dataset: https://github.com/weisongwen/UrbanLoco\n- VBR dataset: https://www.rvp-group.net/slam-dataset.html\n\n### Mapping Test\n\n1. Real-time mapping (real-time bag playback)\n    - Start the mapping program:\n      ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_online --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n    - Play the data bag\n    - Save the map ```ros2 service call /lightning/save_map lightning/srv/SaveMap \"{map_id: new_map}\"```\n2. Offline mapping (traverse data, faster)\n    - ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml --input_bag [bag_file]```\n    - It will automatically save to the data/new_map directory after finishing.\n3. Viewing the map\n    - View the full map: ```pcl_viewer ./data/new_map/global.pcd```\n    - The actual map is stored in blocks, global.pcd is only for displaying the result.\n    - map.pgm sto",

These are the hotkeys:\n\n| Key | Description                                     |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------|\n| F1  | Pause/Resume (F12 to step a frame while paused) |\n| F2  | Slow Motion                                     |\n| F3  | Fast Forward                                    |\n| F5  | Save State Quick Save                           |\n| F7  | Switch Full Screen and Windowed Mode            |\n| F9  | Save State Quick Load                           |\n| F11 | Lock Mouse to Window                            |\n| F12 | Toggle On-Screen Menu                           |\n\nUse the `General > Fast Forward/Slow Motion Mode` setting to swap between holding or toggling mode.\n\nIn addition, you can set the `General > Middle Mouse Button Open Menu` setting for easier access to the menu.\n\n## Features\n\n### Load Games from ZIP\nDOSBox Pure can load games directly from ZIP files without the need to extract them.\n\n### Store Modifications in Separate Save File\nChanges made to a loaded ZIP file will be stored as a separate ZIP file into the saves directory.  \nIf a game is loaded directly without using a container like ZIP or ISO the saves directory is not used.\n\n### Mount Disk Images from Inside ZIP Files\nCD images (ISO or CUE) and floppy disk images (IMG/IMA/VHD/JRC) can be mounted directly from inside ZIP files.  \nThe system will automatically mount the first found disk image as the A: or D: drive.  \nAdditional disks can be loaded or swapped by using the [start menu](#start-menu).\n\n### Start Menu\n![Start Menu](images/startmenu.png)\n\nThis is the first screen that appears after loading a game. It offers a gamepad controllable list\nwith all executable files of the loaded game. In addition it can load new content and swap which floppy disk or CD is inserted.\n\nBy using the tabs at the bottom, you can view the [Gamepad Mapper](#gamepad-mapper), the [System Settings](#system-settings)\nand while a game is running access the [On-Screen Keyboard](#on-screen-keyboard).\n\nWhile a game is running, you can open the menu again by pressing CTRL+F12 or L3 on the gamepad (usually by pushing in the left analog stick).\nThe keyboard hotkey can be modified in the [System Settings](#system-settings) and the gamepad button can be changed in the [Gamepad Mapper](#gamepad-mapper).\n\n### System Settings\nBy switching to the SYSTEM tab in the [start menu](#start-menu) you will find all program and emulation settings divided into various categories.\nEach setting has a list of options and a detailed description next to it.\n\n### Auto Start\nWhile in the [start menu](#start-menu), you can press right to set an item as the default which will skip the menu the next time the same content is loaded.\nBy pressing right multiple times, a number of frames can be specified that will automatically be skipped on start.\nThis can be used to skip over loading screens or start-up sequences.  \nIf there is only a single choice, the menu will not show and directly run the only executable file.\n\n### On-Screen Keyboard\n![On-Screen Keyboard](images/onscreenkeyboard.png)\n\nBy pressing L3 on the gamepad (usually by pushing in the left analog stick) t",

This provides\nboth the high level collectives API as well as several out of the box backends.\n\n* [Documentation](https://meta-pytorch.org/torchcomms/main/index.html)\n* [Examples](./comms/torchcomms/examples)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\ntorchcomms requires the following software and hardware:\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- PyTorch 2.8 or higher\n- CUDA-capable GPU (for NCCL/NCCLX or RCCL backends)\n\n## Installation\n\ntorchcomms is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip. Alternatively,\nyou can build torchcomms from source.\n\n### Using pip (Nightly Builds)\n\nYou can install torchcomms and PyTorch nightly builds using pip:\n\n```bash\n# Cuda 12.6\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126\n\n# Cuda 12.8\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128\n\n# Cuda 12.9\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu129\n\n# Cuda 13.0\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130\n```\n\n### Building from Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- CMake 3.22 or higher\n- Ninja 1.10 or higher\n\nAlternatively, you can build torchcomms from source. If you want to build the NCCLX backend, we recommend building it under a virtual conda environment.\nRun the following commands to build and install torchcomms:\n\n```bash\n# Create a conda environment\nconda create -n torchcomms python=3.10\nconda activate torchcomms\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone git@github.com:meta-pytorch/torchcomms.git\ncd torchcomms\n```\n\n#### Build the backend (choose one based on your hardware):\n\n##### Standard NCCL Backend\n\nNo build needed - uses the library provided by PyTorch\n\n##### NCCLX Backend\n\nIf you want to install the third-party dependencies directly from conda, run the following command:\n```bash\nUSE_SYSTEM_LIBS=1 ./build_ncclx.sh\n```\n\nIf you want to build and install the third-party dependencies from source, run the following command:\n```bash\n./build_ncclx.sh\n```\n\n##### RCCL Backend\n\nInstall some prerequisites\n```\nconda install conda-forge::glog=0.4.0 conda-forge::gflags conda-forge::fmt -y\n```\n\nEnvironment variables to find rocm/rccl headers\n```\nexport ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm\nexport RCCL_INCLUDE=$ROCM_HOME/include/rccl\n```\n\n```bash\n./build_rccl.sh\n```\n\n##### RCCLX Backend\n\nInstall some prerequisites\n```\nconda install conda-forge::glog=0.4.0 conda-forge::gflags conda-forge::fmt -y\n```\n\nEnvironment variables to find rocm/rcclx headers\n```\nexport BUILD_DIR=${PWD}/comms/rcclx/develop/build/release/build\nexport ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm\nexport RCCLX_INCLUDE=${BUILD_DIR}/include/rccl\nexport RCCLX_LIB=${BUILD_DIR}/lib\n```\n\n```bash\n./build_rcclx.sh\n```\n\n\n#### Install torchcomms:\n\n```bash\n# Install PyTorch (if not already installed)\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation -v .\n```\n\n### Build Configuration\n\nYou can customize the build by setting environment variables before running pip install:\n\n```bash\n# Enable/disable specific backends (ON/OFF or 1/0)\nexport USE_NCCL=ON    # Default: ON\nexport USE_NCCLX=ON   # Default: ON\nexport USE_GLOO=ON    # Default: ON\nexport USE_RCCL=OFF   # Default: OFF\nexport USE_RCCLX=OFF  # Default: OFF\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\n# Install PyTorch (if not already installed)\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation -v .\n```\n\n## Quick Start Example\n\nHere's a simple example demonstrating synchronous `AllReduce` communication across multiple GPUs:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# example.py\nimport torch\nfrom torchcomms import new_comm, ReduceOp\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize TorchComm with NCCLX backend\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    torchcomm = new_comm(\"nccl\", device, name=\"main_comm\")\n\n    # Get rank and world size\n    rank = torchcomm.get_rank()\n    world_size = torchcomm.get_size()\n\n    # Calculate device ID\n    num_devices = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    device_id = rank % num_devices\n    target_device = torch.device(f\"cuda:{device_id}\")\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}/{world_size}: Running on device {device_id}\")\n\n    # Create a tensor with rank-specific data\n    tensor = torch.full(\n        (1024,),\n        float(rank + 1),\n        dtype=torch.float32,\n        device=target_device\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}: Before AllReduce: {tensor[0].item()}\")\n\n    # Perform synchronous AllReduce (sum across all ranks)\n    torchcomm.all_reduce(tensor, ReduceOp.SUM, async_op=False)\n\n    # Synchronize CUDA stream\n    torch.cuda.current_stream().synchronize()\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}: After AllReduce: {tensor[0].item()}\")\n\n    # Cleanup\n    torchcomm.finalize()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Running the Example\n\nTo run this example with multiple processes (one per GPU):\n\n`",

      "readme": "# HipKittens\n\nHipKittens is a repository in the ThunderKittens cinematic universe! This work provides minimal, opinionated C++ embedded programming primitives to help you write speedy AMD AI kernels. HipKittens is built from the hardware up: we do what the silicon tells us. \n\n<div align=\"center\" >\n    <img src=\"assets/hipkittens.png\" height=250 alt=\"HipKittens logo\" style=\"margin-bottom:px\"/> \n      <p><em>HipKittens surfing the ~wave~ (not warp).</em></p>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n**Links**: [Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08083) | [Blog: Fast and Furious AMD Kernels](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-09-hk) | [Blog: AMD GPUs go brrr](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-11-09-amd-brr)\n\n**AI has largely used a single hardware vendor in the past, but how can we enable a *multi-silicon* future?** Towards the dream of a single software framework that translates across hardware platforms, we explore whether the primitives used in prior DSLs (like TK) suffice for AMD, or whether we need entirely new primitives.\n\nWe find that core tile and bulk compute interfaces carry over from TK to HK, but decisions around memory access patterns, scheduling compute and memory, and ordering thread blocks within the chiplet architecture differ. HipKittens features the following types of primitives. \n1. **Tile primitives**: sized according to the tensor core units. Tile memory ops are coalesced, bank conflict free, and eagerly use tensor core layouts. We focus on minimizing address computation costs. \n2. **Python-inspired functions**: bulk compute functions that operate over tiles. These are lightweight, wrapping assembly and HIP.\n3. **Asynchronous loads/stores**: hide latencies and address generation using direct buffer loads to shared memory.\n4. **Scheduling and overlapping**: we show two core patterns for overlapping compute and memory, 8-wave ping pong and 4-wave interelave, that appear across kernels.\n\nWe support CDNA3 and CDNA 4. \n\n## Setup\n\n```bash\n# clone the repo\ngit clone git@github.com:HazyResearch/HipKittens.git\n\n# obtain an amd docker using docker pull or podman pull\npodman pull docker.io/rocm/7.0-preview:rocm7.0_preview_pytorch_training_mi35x_beta\n\n# enter the docker\npodman run -it \\\n    --ipc=host \\\n    --network=host \\\n    --privileged \\\n    --cap-add=CAP_SYS_ADMIN \\\n    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \\\n    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \\\n    --device=/dev/kfd \\\n    --device=/dev/dri \\\n    -v $(pwd):/workdir/ \\\n    -e USE_FASTSAFETENSOR=1 \\\n    -e SAFETENSORS_FAST_GPU=1 \\\n    rocm/7.0-preview:rocm7.0_preview_pytorch_training_mi35x_beta \\\n    bash\n\n# set the environment variables\ncd HipKittens/\nsource env.src\n\n# install aiter (baseline kernels)\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/ROCm/aiter.git\ncd aiter\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n## Unit tests\n\nWe provide unit tests for you to optionally test the correctness of library functions. \n\n```bash\ncd HipKittens/tests/unit\nmake -j64\n```\n\n## Quick start: running kernels\n\nWe assume you will run the following on an MI350X or MI355X unless otherwise specified. You should use the CDNA3 branch of HK to run on the MI300X or MI325X.\n\n1. **BF16 GEMM**\n```bash\n# Defaults to 8192x8192x8192\n# This will compare to AITER and PyTorch automatically.\ncd kernels/gemm/bf16fp32/mi350x/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py\n\n# On the mi300x or mi325x run:\ngit checkout cdna3 # not the main branch!\ncd kernels/gemm/bf16fp32/mi325x/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py\n```\n\n2. **Attention forwards (MHA, GQA, Causal, Non-causal, Head dim 128 / 64)**\n\n```bash\n# GQA, Non-causal, D=128, N=2048, H=64, H_KV=8, B=16:\n# This will compare to AITER automatically. \ncd kernels/attn/gqa/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py\n```\n\n- Modify the ```ATTN_N``` sequence length (e.g., 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192), ```ATTN_H``` query heads and ```ATTN_H_KV``` key value heads (e.g., 16 and 16 for MHA), ```ATTN_D``` head dimension (i.e., 64 or 128) in the Makefile and test_python.py file to try other settings.\n- Use the same process for [gqa_causal](https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens/tree/main/kernels/attn/gqa_causal).\n\n3. **Attention backwards (MHA, GQA, Causal, Non-causal, Head dim 128 / 64)**\n\n```bash\n# GQA, Non-causal, D=128, N=8192, H=64, H_KV=8, B=16:\n# This will compare to AITER automatically. \ncd kernels/attn/gqa_backwards/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py \n```\n\n- Modify the settings in the same way as stated above for forwards.\n- Try [gqa_causal_backwards](https://github.com/HazyResearch/HipKittens/tree/main/kernels/attn/gqa_causal_backwards).\n\n4. **Memory bound**\n\n```bash\n# Rotary (default B=16, H=16, D=128, N=2048)\n# This will compare to AITER, PyTorch, PyTorch compiled automatically.\ncd kernels/rotary/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py\n```\n\n```bash\n# Layernorm fused (default B=16, H=16, D=128, N=4096)\n# This will compare to PyTorch, PyTorch compiled automatically.\ncd kernels/layernorm/\nmake clean && make\npython test_python.py\n```\n\nPotental issues:\n- If you see",

This is the native format used by `NtCreateUserProcess` and bypasses some Win32 path parsing mechanisms.\n\n## Shellcode Execution Methods\n\n### 1. Direct RIP Hijacking\n```\nOriginal State:          Modified State:\n┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐\n│ RIP: ntdll   │   →    │ RIP: 0x7FFE  │ (shellcode)\n│ RAX: ...     │        │ RAX: ...     │\n└──────────────┘        └──────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Simple and reliable.  \n**Detection Risk**: High - RIP directly pointing to non-module memory is easily detected by EDR thread scanning.\n\n### 2. JMP RAX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE0)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE0    │    →        │ RAX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: RIP points to legitimate ntdll.dll, more stealthy than direct hijacking.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Suspicious RAX value and unusual gadget execution may trigger heuristics.\n\n### 3. JMP RBX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE3)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE3    │    →        │ RBX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Similar to JMP RAX, RIP remains in legitimate module space.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Same as JMP RAX, slightly different register makes detection signatures less common.\n\n### 4. Callback Function Hijacking\n```\nEnumResourceTypesW(hModule, lpEnumFunc, lParam)\n                              ↓\n                    RCX = NULL\n                    RDX = shellcode address\n                    R8  = NULL\n```\n**Advantage**: Leverages legitimate callback mechanism, appears as normal Windows API usage.  \n**Detection",

ARM64 builds will work on any ARM64 CPU.\n\nIf you have issues with crashes on startup, make sure your graphics drivers are fully up to date. \n\n## Features\n\n#### Plug and Play\nSimply provide your copy of the North American version of the game in the main menu and start playing! This project will automatically load assets from the provided copy, so there is no need to go through a separate extraction step or build the game yourself.\n\n#### Fully Intact N64 Effects\nA lot of care was put into RT64 to make sure all graphical effects were rendered exactly as they did originally on the N64. No workarounds or \"hacks\" were made to replicate these effects, with the only modifications to them being made for enhancement purposes such as widescreen support.\n\n#### Easy-to-Use Menus\nGameplay settings, graphics settings, input mappings, and audio settings can all be configured with the in-game config menu. The menus can all be used with mouse, controller, or keyboard for maximum convenience.\n\n#### High Framerate Support\nPlay at any framerate you want thanks to functionality provided by RT64! Game objects and terrain, texture scrolling, screen effects, and most HUD elements are all rendered at high framerates. By default, this project is configured to run at your monitor's refresh rate. You can also play at the original framerate of the game if you prefer. **Changing framerate has no effect on gameplay.**\n\n**Note**: External framerate limiters (such as the NVIDIA Control Panel) are known to potentially cause problems, so if you notice any stuttering then turn them off and use the manual framerate slider in the in-game graphics menu instead.\n\n#### Widescreen and Ultrawide Support\nAny aspect ratio is supported, with most effects modded to work correctly in widescreen. The HUD can also be positioned at 16:9 when using ultrawide aspect ratios if preferred.\n\n**Note**: Some animation quirks can be seen at the edges of the screen in certain cutscenes when using very wide aspect ratios.\n\n#### Additional Control Options\nCustomize your experience by setting your stick deadzone to your liking, as well as adjusting the X and Y axis inversion for aiming.\n\n#### Low Input Lag\nThis project has been optimized to have as little input lag as possible, making the game feel more responsive than ever!\n\n#### Linux and Steam Deck Support\nA Linux binary as well as a Flatpak is available for playing on most up-to-date distros, including on the Steam Deck.\n\nTo play on Steam Deck, extract the Linux build onto your deck. Then, in desktop mode, right click the DNZHRecompiled executable file and select \"Add to Steam\". From there, you can return to Gaming mode and configure the controls as needed.\n\n## Planned Features\n* Model Replacements\n* Ray Tracing (via RT64)\n* Multi-language support with support for loading custom translations\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What is static",

      "readme": "# VEH-Based Function Call Obfuscation\n\nObfuscating function calls using Vectored Exception Handlers by redirecting execution through exception-based control flow. Uses byte switching without memory or assembly allocation.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe implementation intercepts function calls by intentionally triggering CPU exceptions instead of using traditional jumps. When a protected function is called, Windows triggers a `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exception. The Vectored Exception Handler catches this exception before normal execution continues, checks if the instruction pointer (RIP/EIP) matches a registered hook entry, and redirects execution to a hook function by modifying the CPU context.\n\nFor persistent hooking, a trap flag is set after redirection. This triggers a `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP` exception after one instruction executes, allowing the handler to automatically restore the PAGE_GUARD protection (since Windows clears it after each violation). This ensures the hook works on every subsequent call without manual intervention.\n\nAn alternative method uses `INT3` breakpoint instructions (byte switching - writing 0xCC) to trigger `STATUS_BREAKPOINT` exceptions for control flow obfuscation, hiding function calls and jumps behind exception handling logic.\n\n**Key Point**: All operations use byte switching - modifying existing code bytes in-place using `vxmovememory()`. No memory allocation, no assembly generation required.\n\n## Two Obfuscation Methods\n\n### Guard Page Violation Method\nProtects target function addresses with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ | PAGE_GUARD` memory protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`. Each function call triggers a guard page violation exception, which the VEH handler intercepts to redirect execution. The handler modifies RIP/EIP bytes in the CPU context structure.\n\n### INT3 Breakpoint Method  \nPlaces `INT3` (0xCC) instruction at target addresses by switching the first byte to 0xCC. Execution hits the breakpoint, triggers `STATUS_BREAKPOINT`, and the handler redirects control flow to obfuscated paths. Uses `NtFlushInstructionCache` to flush CPU cache after byte modification.\n\n## Using the VEH Obfuscation\n\n- Example in ebytesyscalls.cpp\n\n## Key Functions\n\n- `vehhook::initialize()` - Registers the VEH exception handler with Windows\n- `vehhook::addhook(entry)` - Adds hook entry and sets PAGE_GUARD protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n- `vehhook::removehook(entry)` - Removes hook and restores memory protection\n- `vehhook::findhook(address)` - Finds hook entry by original function address\n- `vehhook::triggerint3hook(target, redirect, entry)` - Installs INT3 breakpoint (switches byte to 0xCC) for control flow obfuscation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe exception handler processes three exception types in order:\n\n1. **STATUS_BREAKPOINT** - INT3 breakpoint hits, redirects execution by modifying RIP/EIP\n2. **STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION** - Guard page accessed, redirects and sets trap flag (EFlags |= 0x100)\n3. **STATUS_SINGLE_STEP** - Trap flag triggered, restores PAGE_GUARD for all hooks via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Memory protection changes use `NtProtectVirtualMemory` via `internals::getprocaddr()` - this is **NOT a direct syscall**, it's the Nt* API resolved dynamically\n- Function addresses are resolved through manual PE parsing via `internals::getprocaddr()` instead of `GetProcAddress()`\n- All byte modifications use `vxmovememory()` - no standard library memory functions\n- INT3 installation uses byte switching (writes 0xCC) then flushes instruction cache via `NtFlushInstructionCache`\n\n## Byte Switching Approach\n\nUnlike traditional hooking that allocates memory or generates assembly:\n- Guard page method: Only modifies memory protection flags (no code bytes changed)\n- INT3 method: Switches one byte (0xCC) in-place, no allocation needed\n- Both methods: Redirect execution via CPU context modification (RIP/EIP), not code patching\n- Exception handlers: Modify existing CPU register state, no new memory required\n\n## Notes\n\nThe VEH obfuscation technique works by leveraging Windows exception handling infrastructure. Control flow redirection happens in the exception handler, making static analysis more difficult since execution jumps aren't visible in the original code.\n\nYou can combine both methods - use guard page hooks for function interception and INT3 breakpoints for general control flow obfuscation throughout your code.\n\nAll operations use byte switching - modifying existing code or CPU state without allocating new memory or generating assembly instructions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis implementation demonstrates exception-based control flow obfuscation. The technique hides execution flow in exception handlers but can be detected through VEH enumeration, exception frequency analysis, or advanced EDR monitoring. Use as one layer of a multi-layered obfuscation strategy.\n\n# License\n- MIT\n\n\n# Credits \n- AdvDebug for hook -> copymem. (github.com/AdvDebug)\n",

The original open-source code targeted a simplified simulator, which made direct deployment to real UAVs challenging. To bridge this gap, we **modified several ROS topics** and integrated a **PX4 flight controller** (via MAVROS), enabling realistic simulation and smoother transition to hardware.\n\n## Key Modifications\nAll changes from the original implementation are **clearly annotated in the source code**, with inline comments explaining **what changed** and **why** the change was required. At a high level, modifications include:\n- Remapping / replacing ROS topics to follow PX4/MAVROS conventions.\n- Adding a PX4 controller interface for attitude / velocity setpoints.\n- Ensuring compatibility with **PX4 + Gazebo** workflows and launch sequences.\n- All modifications compared to the original code are retained **in place** with comments for traceability.\n\n## Simulation Environment\nThis repository is designed for simulation in **PX4 + Gazebo**. If you want to deploy to a **real UAV**, you only need to update the relevant PX4/MAVROS topics to match your hardware setup. For example, the PX4 attitude setpoint topic used in simulation:\n```bash\n/mavros/setpoint_raw/attitude\n```\ncan be redirected to the **equivalent topic** used by your real UAV setup.\n\n## Quick Start\nA one-command startup script is provided:\n```bash\n./start.sh\n```\nThis script launches the simulator, MAVROS bridge, and the exploration stack in the correct order.\n\n## Usage Guide\nDetailed usage (environment setup, dependencies, calibration, example runs) will be provided soon.\n> 🛠️ **Coming soon...**\n\n\n## Future Work\nWe plan to create a separate repository that ports the **RACER** framework to the **PX4 + Gazebo** stack. This will extend the current single-UAV pipeline to multi-robot exploration in SITL.\n\n## References\n- Original research code (paper implementation):  \n  - FUEL: https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL\n\n## Acknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the following projects for inspiration and reference implementations:\n- FUEL: https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL\n- XTDrone: https://github.com/robin-shaun/XTDrone\n- Fast-Exploration: https://github.com/XXLiu-HNU/Fast-Exploration\n\n\n## License\nThis project follows the same open-source spirit as the original FUEL repository.

      "readme": "# REP MOV based EPT detection\n\nThis is a basic POC of detecting EPT based hooking or access watch that verifies behaviour of the string instructions when they fault vs when they can fully execute un-interrupted. [@NickEverdox](https://x.com/nickeverdox/status/1981959428846084269) Decided to release a similar version of the concept, so I might as well release my version that I had come up with independently. The main difference is that I don't rely on on a hardware breakpoint, but rather make the instruction overwrite itself. Emulating this behaviour is also very annoying, because the amount of data copied varies greatly even on the same processor depending on the alignment of source/destination operands and the instruction itself. On machines with E-cores the behaviour can be different even with the same parameters.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid check_ept(const void* address)\n{\n  constexpr uint8_t shellcode[] = {\n    0xFC,                                     // 0:  cld\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xCE,                         // 1:  mov    rsi,rcx\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xD7,                         // 4:  mov    rdi,rdx\n    0x44, 0x89, 0xC1,                         // 7:  mov    ecx, r8d\n    0xF3, 0x48, 0xA5,                         // a:  rep movs QWORD PTR es:[rdi], QWORD PTR ds:[rsi]\n    0xC3                                      // d:  ret\n  };\n  constexpr uint32_t offset_repmov = 0xA;\n\n  const auto code = (char*)VirtualAlloc(nullptr, 0x2000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n  const auto repmov_addr = code + 0x1020;\n  const auto shellcode_addr = repmov_addr - offset_repmov;\n\n  code[0] = 0;\n  memcpy(shellcode_addr, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));\n\n  Sleep(100);\n\n  __try\n  {\n    ((void(*)(const void* src, void* dst, uint32_t cnt))shellcode_addr)(address, code + 0xF00, 0x200 / 8);\n  }\n  __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)\n  {\n  }\n\n  // REP MOVS will overshoot the copy on every platform except when we're faulting every iteration of the instruction due to EPT.\n  bool is_ok = repmov_addr[8] != 0;\n\n  uint32_t overwrite_count = std::count_if(repmov_addr, repmov_addr + 0x100, [](unsigned char c) { return c != 0; });\n  printf(\"OVERWRITES: %u %s\\n\", overwrite_count, is_ok ? \"NOT DETECTED\" : \"DETECTED\");\n\n  VirtualFree(code, 0, MEM_RELEASE);\n}\n```\n",

      "readme": "# EtwLeakKernel\n\nThis repository contains a PoC for a program that utilizes ETW to leak kernel memory addresses. It does so by creating a consumer (could be to almost any provider as almost all of them leak kernel addresses) and requesting a stack trace from it. Once the stack trace is received, it is parsed to extract the kernel memory addresses. Since Microsoft do not consider administrator to kernel as a security boundary, this situation won't change any time soon. Might be useful in some exploitation scenarios (**e.g. wanting to leak the kernel base address if you know that an ETW provider leaks a kernel address which is in a certain offset from the kernel base address or any other interesting address for that matter**) or just as a party trick.\n\n**Bare in mind** that administrative privileges are required to *start consuming* from ETW providers. If there is already a program that consumes ETW events that normal user has access to the trace, the normal user will be able to leak kernel addresses as well. It does not provide any leak of actual kernel data, just kernel addresses (unless in maybe an extreme edge cases).\n\n![poc](./Resources/poc.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can see an example of how to use in [EtwLeakKernel](./EtwLeakKernel/EtwLeakKernel.cpp). You can also use any other ETW consumer and request the stack, in this example it is using `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`.\n\n## Setup\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [VS 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)\n\n### Cloning\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/Idov31/EtwLeakKernel --recursive\n```\n",

      "readme": "# Technical Writeup: version.dll Sideloading, Proxying, and Hooking\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document provides a detailed technical analysis of a proof-of-concept that demonstrates DLL sideloading by targeting `OneDrive.exe` with a malicious `version.dll`. This technique is leveraged for achieving persistence, evading defenses, and executing arbitrary code within the context of a trusted process. The proof-of-concept further employs DLL proxying to maintain the normal operation of the host application and utilizes a sophisticated hooking mechanism based on Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and hardware-like breakpoints to intercept and modify application behavior.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### DLL Sideloading\n\nDLL sideloading is a common attack vector where a legitimate application is tricked into loading a malicious DLL instead of the intended one. This is often possible due to the way Windows resolves DLL dependencies, following a specific search order. If an attacker can place a malicious DLL in a directory that is searched before the legitimate DLL's location, the malicious library will be loaded. This technique is particularly effective for defense evasion as the malicious code executes under the umbrella of a trusted, and often signed, executable.\n\nIn this proof-of-concept, `OneDrive.exe` is the target application, and `version.dll` is the sideloaded library. Many applications, including `OneDrive.exe`, have a dependency on `version.dll` for retrieving file version information. By placing a custom `version.dll` in the application's directory, we can hijack the loading process.\n\n### DLL Proxying\n\nSimply replacing a required DLL with a malicious one would likely cause the host application to crash if it cannot find the necessary functions (exports) it expects from that DLL. To circumvent this, DLL proxying is employed. The malicious DLL is crafted to export the same functions as the original, legitimate DLL. When the host application calls one of these functions, the proxy DLL can either execute its own malicious code, pass the call through to the original DLL, or both. This maintains the application's stability while allowing the malicious code to operate.\n\nThe `exports.h` file in this project demonstrates this technique. It uses `#pragma comment(linker, \"/export:...\")` directives to forward all the expected exports from the proxy `version.dll` to the legitimate `version.dll` located in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`. This ensures that any calls made by `OneDrive.exe` to functions within `version.dll` are correctly handled by the original library, preventing crashes and raising less suspicion.\n\n### API Hooking with Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and PAGE_GUARD\n\nA key component of this proof-of-concept is its advanced method for API hooking. Instead of traditional methods like inline hooking, which can be detected by security products, this implementation uses a more covert technique involving Vectored Exception Handling (VEH) and memory page protection.\n\nVEH is a mechanism in Windows that allows developers to register a function to be called whenever an exception occurs in a process. This proof-of-concept intentionally triggers exceptions to gain control of the execution flow.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.  **Installation**: The `InstallHook` function in `hook.cpp` retrieves the address of the target function, `CreateWindowExW`, from `user32.dll`.\n2.  **VEH Registration**: It then registers a custom exception handler, `VectoredHandler`, using `AddVectoredExceptionHandler`.\n3.  **Triggering Exceptions**: The key to this technique is modifying the memory protection of the target function's first byte. `VirtualProtect` is used to add the `PAGE_GUARD` flag to the memory page containing `CreateWindowExW`. When the application attempts to execute this function, a `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exception is raised.\n4.  **Exception Handling**: The `VectoredHandler` catches this specific exception. It then redirects the instruction pointer (`Rip` in the context record) to our malicious function, `HookedCreateWindowExW`.\n5.  **Re-arming the Hook**: After the exception is handled, the `PAGE_GUARD` is removed by the system. To ensure the hook remains active for subsequent calls, the handler also sets the single-step flag (`EFlags |= 0x100`). This causes a `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP` exception after the next instruction executes, which is also caught by our handler. Inside the single-step handler, the `PAGE_GUARD` is reapplied to the original function's memory page.\n\nThis method of hooking is stealthy because it doesn't directly modify the code of the hooked function in a persistent way, making it more difficult for security software to detect.\n\n## Code Breakdown\n\n### `dllmain.cpp`\n\nThis is the entry point of our malicious DLL. When the DLL is loaded into the `OneDrive.exe` process (`DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH`), it performs the following actions:\n*   `DisableThreadLibraryCalls(hModule)`: An optimization to prevent the DLL from receiving threa",

      "readme": "# SILVERPICK\r\n\r\n## VERSION\r\n\r\n- `v1.0`\r\n\r\n## BRIEF\r\n\r\nProject `SILVERPICK` is a `Windows User-Mode Shellcode Development Framework (WUMSDF)` whose sole purpose is to empower capability developers to build `Position Independent Code (PIC)` blobs for `Windows` `x64` using `C/C++` in an easy manner so as to reduce the development costs of such an endeavour.\r\n\r\nIt derives from project [WILDBEAST](https://github.com/winterknife/WILDBEAST) and, as such, leverages:\r\n1. `Visual Studio Code` as the code editor\r\n2. `MinGW-w64` toolchain as the compiler toolchain\r\n3. `GNU Make` as the build system\r\n\r\n## SETUP\r\n\r\nYou may find the setup instructions from here: [GCC-Clang-Setup-Windows](https://gist.github.com/winterknife/0b177a75a55bad895b19aad64cffa14f)\r\n\r\nPlease note that this project is using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).\r\n\r\n## FEATURES\r\n\r\nWriting shellcode in higher-level programming languages is nothing new, and countless blog posts and research papers have been published on the same since 2010. So, what is new in `SILVERPICK`?\r\n\r\nWell, I am glad that you asked.\r\n\r\n`SILVERPICK` has a nice little bag of tricks hidden up its sleeve, but most of all, this is my take on the subject.\r\n\r\nSo, without further ado, I present to you my first trick.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 01\r\n\r\nEver since Matt Graeber popularised writing shellcode in `C`, most people have been using his [16-byte stack alignment stub written in `Assembly` language](https://github.com/mattifestation/PIC_Bindshell/blob/master/PIC_Bindshell/AdjustStack.asm).\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a problem, seeing as how we aren't `IKEA`, assembly should not be necessary, and indeed it is not.\r\n\r\nThere exists a [`GCC` Function Attribute](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html) that will emit the stack alignment stub for you.\r\n\r\nMeet the `force_align_arg_pointer` function attribute in the form of a helpful [ALIGN_STACK](/Inc/Common.h#L84) macro, which generates the following assembly:\r\n```asm\r\nDisassembly of section .init:\r\n\r\n<PicEntry>:\r\n\tpush   rbp\r\n\tmov    rbp,rsp\r\n\tand    rsp,0xfffffffffffffff0\r\n\tsub    rsp,0x20\r\n\tcall   <PicEntry+0x11>\tIMAGE_REL_AMD64_REL32\t.text$payload\r\n\tleave\r\n\tret\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's the `.init` section, you ask? Well, that serves as a nice segue into my second trick.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 02\r\n\r\nMatt Graeber might have popularised writing shellcode in `C` at some point, but really, it was Paul Ungur who revived this black art with [Stardust](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Stardust).\r\n\r\nNow, `Stardust` uses a [Binutils linker script](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Scripts.html) to control the placement of functions and data into the appropriate `PE` section in the correct order. This technique itself is derived from Austin Hudson's work, and many people use a variant of his linker scripts.\r\n\r\nWhile linker scripts are great for linker section ordering, if all you need is to place a certain function at the beginning of the code section, they are unnecessary.\r\n\r\nEnter the `section` function attribute with a special section name called `.init`, which indicates to the linker that the function contains pre-`main()` runtime initialization code and must be _first_ in the link order.\r\n\r\nTo this effect, the [CODE_BEGIN](/Inc/Common.h#L81) macro has been created.\r\n\r\n### TRICK 03\r\n\r\nFor my third trick, I present to you the [STACK_STRING](/Inc/StackString.h#L35) macro.\r\n\r\nIn `C`, you can create a stack string (a string that is dynamically built on the stack) by declaring the string literal as an array of `ANSI` characters:\r\n```c\r\nchar charrHelloKitty[] = { 'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'K', 'i', 't', 't', 'y', '\\0' };\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `C++`, you can create a stack string by simply marking a `char` array as `constexpr`:\r\n```cpp\r\nconstexpr char charrHelloKitty[]{ \"HelloKitty\" };\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, both of these techniques are rendered useless in the face of compiler optimizations _if_ the string literals are sufficiently large, unlike our solution, which will work regardless of the string length and the level of compiler optimizations, thanks to some clever `C++` template metaprogramming hack courtesy of Can Bölük.\r\n\r\nUsing this macro is pretty straightforward:\r\n```c\r\nSTACK_STRING(sstrText, \"an extra long hello world!\");\r\nSTACK_STRING(sstrCaption, \"Demo\");\r\n\r\nMessageBoxA(nullptr, sstrText.data(), sstrCaption.data(), MB_OK);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate the following assembly:\r\n```asm\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_23], 61h ; 'a'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_22], 6Eh ; 'n'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_21], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_20], 65h ; 'e'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1F], 78h ; 'x'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1E], 74h ; 't'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1D], 72h ; 'r'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1C], 61h ; 'a'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1B], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_1A], 6Ch ; 'l'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_19], 6Fh ; 'o'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_18], 6Eh ; 'n'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_17], 67h ; 'g'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_16], 20h ; ' '\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_15], 68h ; 'h'\r\nmov     [rsp+58h+var_14], 65h ; 'e'\r\nmov     [r",
