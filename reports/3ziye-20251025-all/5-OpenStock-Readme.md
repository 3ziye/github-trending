## ✨ Introduction

OpenStock is a modern stock market app powered by Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, Better Auth for authentication, MongoDB for persistence, Finnhub for market data, and TradingView widgets for charts and market views.

## 🌍 Open Dev Society Manifesto <a name="manifesto"></a>

We live in a world where knowledge is hidden behind paywalls. Where tools are locked in subscriptions. Where information is twisted by bias. Where newcomers are told they’re not “good enough” to build.

We believe there’s a better way.

- Our Belief: Technology should belong to everyone. Knowledge should be open, free, and accessible. Communities should welcome newcomers with trust, not gatekeeping.
- Our Mission: Build free, open-source projects that make a real difference:
    - Tools that professionals and students can use without barriers.
    - Knowledge platforms where learning is free, forever.
    - Communities where every beginner is guided, not judged.
    - Resources that run on trust, not profit.
- Our Promise: We will never lock knowledge. We will never charge for access. We will never trade trust for money. We run on transparency, donations, and the strength of our community.
- Our Call: If you’ve ever felt you didn’t belong, struggled to find free resources, or wanted to build something meaningful — you belong here.

Because the future belongs to those who build it openly.
