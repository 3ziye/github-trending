Vocat is an open-source web control panel and engineering toolkit for Quectel EC20/EC25-class cellular modems. It combines modem discovery, live radio status, AT and USSD terminals, SMS, WiFi Calling, eSIM management, network selection, proxy routing, notifications, audit logs, and release automation in one self-contained service.

The backend is written in Go, the interface is built with React and TypeScript, and the production frontend is embedded into the Go binary. A single executable contains the web application and uses SQLite for persistent state.
