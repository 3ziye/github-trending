      "readme": "# Claude for Financial Services Plugins\n\nPlugins that turn Claude into a specialist for financial services — investment banking, equity research, private equity, and wealth management. Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).\n\n## Why Plugins\n\nCowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how your firm does analysis, which data sources to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.\n\nEach plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific financial services workflow. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your firm — your models, your templates, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.\n\n## What is Claude for Financial Services?\n\nClaude for Financial Services is a comprehensive solution built on Claude for Enterprise with specialized capabilities for financial analysis. It connects Claude to the data sources and tools financial professionals use daily — eliminating the need to juggle multiple browser tabs and improving source verification to reduce the risk of errors from manual data gathering.\n\n## End-to-End Workflows\n\nThese plugins aren't just a collection of point tools — they enable complete workflows that span research, analysis, modeling, and output creation:\n\n- **Research to Report**: Pull real-time data from MCP providers, analyze earnings results, and generate publication-ready equity research reports — all in a single session\n- **Spreadsheet Analysis**: Build comparable company analyses, DCF models, and LBO models as fully functional Excel workbooks with live formulas, sensitivity tables, and industry-standard formatting\n- **Financial Modeling**: Populate 3-statement models from SEC filings, cross-check assumptions against peer data, and stress-test scenarios — with blue/black/green color coding conventions built in\n- **Deal Materials**: Draft CIMs, teasers, and process letters, then generate pitch deck slides and strip profiles using your firm's branded PowerPoint templates\n- **Portfolio to Presentation**: Screen opportunities, run diligence checklists, build IC memos, and track portfolio KPIs — moving seamlessly from data to deliverable\n\nEach workflow connects upstream data sources (via MCP) to downstream outputs (Excel, PowerPoint, Word), so you move from question to finished work product without context-switching.\n\n## Plugin Marketplace\n\nStart with **financial analysis** — the core plugin that provides shared modeling tools and all MCP data connectors. Then add any function-specific plugins to enhance Claude's capabilities for your workflow.\n\n| Plugin | Type | How it helps | Connectors |\n|--------|------|-------------|------------|\n| **[financial analysis](./financial-analysis)** | Core (install first) | Build comps, DCF models, LBO models, and 3-statement financials.

The original version of PaperBanana is already open-sourced under Google-Research as [PaperVizAgent](https://github.com/google-research/papervizagent). \nThis repository forked the content of that repo and aims to keep evolving toward better support for academic paper illustration—though we have made solid progress, there is still a long way to go for more reliable generation and for more diverse, complex scenarios. PaperBanana is intended to be a fully open-source project dedicated to facilitating academic illustration for all researchers. Our goal is simply to benefit the community, so we currently have no plans to use it for commercial purposes.\n\n\n\n\n**PaperBanana** is a reference-driven multi-agent framework for automated academic illustration generation. Acting like a creative team of specialized agents, it transforms raw scientific content into publication-quality diagrams and plots through an orchestrated pipeline of **Retriever, Planner, Stylist, Visualizer, and Critic** agents. The framework leverages in-context learning from reference examples and iterative refinement to produce aesthetically pleasing and semantically accurate scientific illustrations.\n\nHere are some example diagrams and plots generated by PaperBanana:\n![Examples](assets/teaser_figure.jpg)\n\n## Overview of PaperBanana\n\n![PaperBanana Framework](assets/method_diagram.png)\n\nPaperBanana achieves high-quality academic illustration generation by orchestrating five specialized agents in a structured pipeline:\n\n1. **Retriever Agent**: Identifies the most relevant reference diagrams from a curated collection to guide downstream agents\n2. **Planner Agent**: Translates method content and communicative intent into comprehensive textual descriptions using in-context learning\n3. **Stylist Agent**: Refines descriptions to adhere to academic aesthetic standards using automatically synthesized style guidelines\n4. **Visualizer Agent**: Transforms textual descriptions into visual outputs using state-of-the-art image generation models\n5. **Critic Agent**: Forms a closed-loop refinement mechanism with the Visualizer through multi-round iterative improvements\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step1: Clone the Repo\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dwzhu-pku/PaperBanana.git\ncd PaperBanana\n```\n\n### Step2: Configuration\nPaperBanana supports configuring API keys from a YAML configuration file or via environment variables. \n\nWe recommend duplicate the `configs/model_config.template.yaml` file into `configs/model_config.yaml` to externalize all user configurations. This file is ignored by git to keep your api keys and configurations secret. In `model_config.yaml`, remember to fill in the two model names (`defaults.model_name` and `defaults.image_model_name`) and set at least one API key under `api_keys` (e.g. `google_api_key` for Gemini models).\n\nNote that if you need to generate many candidates simultaneously, you will require an API key that supports high concurrency.\n\n### Step3: Downloading the Dataset\nFirst download [PaperBananaBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dwzhu/PaperBananaBench), then place it under the `data` directory (e.g., `data/PaperBananaBench/`). The framework is designed to function gracefully without the dataset by bypassing the Retriever Agent's few-shot learning capability. If interested in the original PDFs, please download them from [PaperBananaDiagramPDFs](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dwzhu/PaperBananaDiagramPDFs).\n\n### Step4: Installing the Environment\n1. We use `uv` to manage Python packages. Please install `uv` following the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).\n\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment\n    ```bash\n    uv venv # This will create a virtual environment in the current directory, under .venv/\n    source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows\n    ```\n\n3. Install python 3.12\n    ```bash\n    uv python install 3.12\n    ```\n\n4. Install required packages\n    ```bash\n    uv pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n### Launch PaperBanana\n\n#### Interactive Demo (Streamlit)\nThe easiest way to launch PaperBanana is via the interactive Streamlit demo:\n```bash\nstreamlit run demo.py\n```\n\nThe web interface provides two main workflows:\n\n**1. Generate Candidates Tab**:\n- Paste your method section content (Markdown recommended) and provide the figure caption.\n- Configure settings (pipeline mode, retrieval setting, number of candidates, aspect ratio, critic rounds).\n- Click \"Generate Candidates\" and wait for parallel processing.\n-",

已经能帮你写代码、改文档、管项目——但你让它去网上找点东西，它就抓瞎了：\n\n- 📺 \"帮我看看这个 YouTube 教程讲了什么\" → **看不了**，拿不到字幕\n- 🐦 \"帮我搜一下推特上大家怎么评价这个产品\" → **搜不了**，Twitter API 要付费\n- 📖 \"去 Reddit 上看看有没有人遇到过同样的 bug\" → **403 被封**，服务器 IP 被拒\n- 📕 \"帮我看看小红书上这个品的口碑\" → **打不开**，必须登录才能看\n- 📺 \"B站上有个技术视频，帮我总结一下\" → **连不上**，海外/服务器 IP 被屏蔽\n- 🔍 \"帮我在网上搜一下最新的 LLM 框架对比\" → **没有好用的搜索**，要么付费要么质量差\n- 🌐 \"帮我看看这个网页写了啥\" → **抓回来一堆 HTML 标签**，根本没法读\n- 📦 \"这个 GitHub 仓库是干嘛的？Issue 里说了什么？\" → 能用，但认证配置很麻烦\n- 📡 \"帮我订阅这几个 RSS 源，有更新告诉我\" → 要自己装库写代码\n\n**这些不难实现，但是需要自己折腾配置**\n\n每个平台都有自己的门槛——要付费的 API、要绕过的封锁、要登录的账号、要清洗的数据。你要一个一个去踩坑、装工具、调配置，光是让 Agent 能读个推特就得折腾半天。\n\n**Agent Reach 把这件事变成一句话：**\n\n```\n帮我安装 Agent Reach：https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md\n```\n\n复制给你的 Agent，几分钟后它就能读推特、搜 Reddit、看 YouTube、刷小红书了。\n\n> ⭐ **Star 这个项目**，我们会持续追踪各平台的变化、接入新的渠道。你不用自己盯——平台封了我们修，有新渠道我们加。\n\n### ✅ 在你用之前，你可能想知道\n\n| | |\n|---|---|\n| 💰 **完全免费** | 所有工具开源、所有 API 免费。唯一可能花钱的是服务器代理（$1/月），本地电脑不需要 |\n| 🔒 **隐私安全** | Cookie 只存在你本地，不上传不外传。代码完全开源，随时可审查 |\n| 🔄 **持续更新** | 底层工具（yt-dlp、xreach、Jina Reader 等）定期追踪更新到最新版，你不用自己盯 |\n| 🤖 **兼容所有 Agent** | Claude Code、OpenClaw、Cursor、Windsurf……任何能跑命令行的 Agent 都能用 |\n| 🩺 **自带诊断** | `agent-reach doctor` 一条命令告诉你哪个通、哪个不通、怎么修 |\n\n---\n\n## 支持的平台\n\n| 平台 | 装好即用 | 配置后解锁 | 怎么配 |\n|------|---------|-----------|-------|\n| 🌐 **网页** | 阅读任意网页 | — | 无需配置 |\n| 📺 **YouTube** | 字幕提取 + 视频搜索 | — | 无需配置 |\n| 📡 **RSS** | 阅读任意 RSS/Atom 源 | — | 无需配置 |\n| 🔍 **全网搜索** | — | 全网语义搜索 | 自动配置（MCP 接入，免费无需 Key） |\n| 📦 **GitHub** | 读公开仓库 + 搜索 | 私有仓库、提 Issue/PR、Fork | 告诉 Agent「帮我登录 GitHub」 |\n| 🐦 **Twitter/X** | 读单条推文 | 搜索推文、浏览时间线、发推 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配 Twitter」 |\n| 📺 **B站** | 本地：字幕提取 + 搜索 | 服务器也能用 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配代理」 |\n| 📖 **Reddit** | 搜索（通过 Exa 免费） | 读帖子和评论 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配代理」 |\n| 📕 **小红书** | — | 阅读、搜索、发帖、评论、点赞 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配小红书」 |\n| 🎵 **抖音** | — | 视频解析、无水印下载链接获取 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配抖音」 |\n| 💼 **LinkedIn** | Jina Reader 读公开页面 | Profile 详情、公司页面、职位搜索 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配 LinkedIn」 |\n| 🏢 **Boss直聘** | Jina Reader 读职位页 | 搜索职位、向 HR 打招呼 | 告诉 Agent「帮我配 Boss直聘」 |\n\n> **不知道怎么配？不用查文档。** 直接告诉 Agent「帮我配 XXX」，它知道需要什么、会一步一步引导你。\n>\n> 🍪 需要 Cookie 的平台（Twitter、小红书等），**优先使用** Chrome 插件 [Cookie-Editor](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cookie-editor/hlkenndednhfkekhgcdicdfddnkalmdm) 导出 Cookie，发给 Agent 即可配置。流程统一：浏览器登录 → Cookie-Editor 导出 → 发给 Agent。比扫码更简单可靠。\n>\n> 🔒 Cookie 只存在你本地，不上传不外传。代码完全开源，随时可审查。\n> 💻 本地电脑不需要代理。代理只有部署在服务器上才需要（~$1/月）。\n\n---\n\n## 快速上手\n\n复制这句话给你的 AI Agent（Claude Code、OpenClaw、Cursor 等）：\n\n```\n帮我安装 Agent Reach：https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md\n```\n\n就这一步。Agent 会自己完成剩下的所有事情。\n\n> 🛡️ **担心安全？** 可以用安全模式——不会自动装系统包，只告诉你需要什么：\n> ```\n> 帮我安装 Agent Reach（安全模式）：https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Panniantong/agent-reach/main/docs/install.md\n> 安装时使用 --safe 参数\n> ```\n\n<details>\n<summary>它会做什么？（点击展开）</summary>\n\n1. **安装 CLI 工具** — `pip install` 装好 `agent-reach` 命令行\n2. **安装系统依赖** — 自动检测并安装 Node.js、gh CLI、mcporter、xreach 等\n3. **配置搜索引擎** — 通过 MCP 接入 Exa（免费，无需 API Key）\n4. **检测环境** — 判断是本地电脑还是服务器，给出对应的配置建议\n5. **注册 SKILL.md** — 在 Agent 的 skills 目录安装使用指南，以后 Agent 遇到\"搜推特\"、\"看视频\"这类需求，会自动知道该调哪个上游工具\n\n安装完之后，`agent-reach doctor` 一条命令告诉你每个渠道的状态。\n</details>\n\n---\n\n## 装好就能用\n\n不需要任何配置，告诉 Agent 就行：\n\n- \"帮我看看这个链接\" → `curl https://r.jina.ai/URL` 读任意网页\n- \"这个 GitHub 仓库是做什么的\" → `gh repo view owner/repo`\n- \"这个视频讲了什么\" → `yt-dlp --dump-json URL` 提取字幕\n- \"帮我看看这条推文\" → `xreach tweet URL --json`\n- \"订阅这个 RSS\" → `feedparser` 解析\n- \"搜一下 GitHub 上有什么 LLM 框架\" → `gh search repos \"LLM framework\"`\n\n**不需要记命令。** Agent 读了 SKILL.md 之后自己知道该调什么。\n\n---\n\n## 设计理念\n\n**Agent Reach 是一个脚手架（scaffolding），不是框架。**\n\n你给一个新 Agent 装环境的时候，总要花时间去找工具、装依赖、调配置——Twitter 用什么读？Reddit 怎么绕封？YouTube 字幕怎么提取？每次都要重新踩一遍。\n\nAgent Reach 做的事情很简单：**帮你把这些选型和配置的活儿做完了。**\n\n安装完成后，Agent 直接调用上游工具（xreach CLI、yt-dlp、mcporter、gh CLI 等），不需要经过 Agent Reach 的包装层。\n\n### 🔌 每个渠道都是可插拔的\n\n每个平台背后是一个独立的上游工具。**不满意？换掉就行。**\n\n```\nchannels/\n├── web.py          → Jina Reader     ← 可以换成 Firecrawl、Crawl4AI……\n├── twitter.py      → xreach            ← 可以换成

It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves a score of 94.62 on OmniDocBench V1.5, ranking #1 overall, and delivers state-of-the-art results across major document understanding benchmarks, including formula recognition, table recognition, and information extraction.\n\n- **Optimized for Real-World Scenarios**: Designed and optimized for practical business use cases, maintaining robust performance on complex tables, code-heavy documents, seals, and other challenging real-world layouts.\n\n- **Efficient Inference**: With only 0.9B parameters, GLM-OCR supports deployment via vLLM, SGLang, and Ollama, significantly reducing inference latency and compute cost, making it ideal for high-concurrency services and edge deployments.\n\n- **Easy to Use**: Fully open-sourced and equipped with a comprehensive [SDK](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-OCR) and inference toolchain, offering simple installation, one-line invocation, and smooth integration into existing production pipelines.\n\n### News & Updates\n\n- **[Coming Soon]** GLM-OCR Technical Report\n- **[2026.2.12]** Fine-tuning tutorial based on LLaMA-Factory is now available. See: [GLM-OCR Fine-tuning Guide](examples/finetune/README.md)\n\n### Download Model\n\n| Model   | Download Links                                                                                                              | Precision |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| GLM-OCR | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-OCR)<br> [🤖 ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/ZhipuAI/GLM-OCR) | BF16      |\n\n## GLM-OCR SDK\n\nWe provide an SDK for using GLM-OCR more efficiently and conveniently.\n\n### Install SDK\n\n> [UV Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n```bash\n# Install from source\ngit clone https://github.com/zai-org/glm-ocr.git\ncd glm-ocr\nuv venv --python 3.12 --seed && source .venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### Model Deployment\n\nTwo ways to use GLM-OCR:\n\n#### Option 1: Zhipu MaaS API (Recommended for Quick Start)\n\nUse the hosted cloud API – no GPU needed. The cloud service runs the complete GLM-OCR pipeline internally, so the SDK simply forwards your request and returns the result.\n\n1. Get an API key from https://open.bigmodel.cn\n2. Configure `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\npipeline:\n  maas:\n    enabled: true # Enable MaaS mode\n    api_key: your-api-key # Required\n```\n\nThat's it! When `maas.enabled=true`, the SDK acts as a thin wrapper that:\n\n- Forwards your documents to the Zhipu cloud API\n- Returns the results directly (Markdown + JSON layout details)\n- No local processing, no GPU required\n\nInput note (MaaS): the upstream API accepts `file` as a URL or a `data:<mime>;base64,...` data URI.\nIf you have raw base64 without the `data:` prefix, wrap it as a data URI (recommended). The SDK will\nauto-wrap local file paths / bytes / raw base64 into a data URI when calling MaaS.\n\nAPI documentation: https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/guide/models/vlm/glm-ocr\n\n#### Option 2: Self-host with vLLM / SGLang\n\nDeploy the GLM-OCR model locally for full control. The SDK provides the complete pipeline: layout detection, parallel region OCR, and result formatting.\n\n##### Using vLLM\n\nInstall vLLM:\n\n```bash\nuv pip install -U vllm --torch-backend=auto --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly\n# Or use Docker\ndocker pull vllm/vllm-openai:nightly\n```\n\nLaunch the service:\n\n```bash\n# In docker container, uv may not be need for transformers install\nuv pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n\n# Run with MTP for better performance\nvllm serve zai-org/GLM-OCR --allowed-local-media-path / --port 8080 --speculative-config '{\"method\": \"mtp\", \"num_speculative_tokens\": 1}' --served-model-name glm-ocr\n```\n\n##### Using SGLang\n\nIn",

Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and login\n2. Add OS → Local → `http://localhost:8000`\n3. Click \"Connect\"\n\n**Try it** (sample F1 dataset):\n\n- Who won the most F1 World Championships?\n- How many races has Lewis Hamilton won?\n- Compare Ferrari vs Mercedes points 2015-2020\n\n## Why Text-to-SQL Breaks in Practice\n\nOur goal is simple: ask a question in english, get a correct, meaningful answer. But raw LLMs writing SQL hit a wall fast:\n\n- **Schemas lack meaning.**\n- **Types are misleading.**\n- **Tribal knowledge is missing.**\n- **No way to learn from mistakes.**\n- **Results generally lack interpretation.**\n\nThe root cause is missing context and missing memory.\n\nDash solves this with **6 layers of grounded context**, a **self-learning loop** that improves with every query, and a focus on **understanding your question** to deliver insights you can act on.\n\n## The Six Layers of Context\n\n| Layer | Purpose | Source |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| **Table Usage** | Schema, columns, relationships | `knowledge/tables/*.json` |\n| **Human Annotations** | Metrics, definitions, and business rules | `knowledge/business/*.json` |\n| **Query Patterns** | SQL that is known to work | `knowledge/queries/*.sql` |\n| **Institutional Knowledge** | Docs, wikis, external references | MCP (optional) |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and discovered fixes | Agno `Learning Machine` |\n| **Runtime Context** | Live schema changes | `introspect_schema` tool |\n\nThe agent retrieves relevant context at query time via hybrid search, then generates SQL grounded in patterns that already work.\n\n## The Self-Learning Loop\n\nDash improves without retraining or fine-tuning. We call this gpu-poor continuous learning.\n\nIt learns through two complementary systems:\n\n| System | Stores | How It Evolves |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **Knowledge** | Validated queries and business context | Curated by you + dash |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and fixes | Managed by `Learning Machine` automatically |\n\n```\nUser Question\n     ↓\nRetrieve Knowledge + Learnings\n     ↓\nReason about intent\n     ↓\nGenerate grounded SQL\n     ↓\nExecute and interpret\n     ↓\n ┌────┴────┐\n ↓         ↓\nSuccess    Error\n ↓         ↓\n ↓         Diagnose → Fix → Save Learning\n ↓                           (never repeated)\n ↓\nReturn insight\n ↓\nOptionally save as Knowledge\n```\n\n**Knowledge** is curated—validated queries and business context you want the agent to build on.\n\n**Learnings** is discovered—patterns the agent finds through trial and error. When a query fails because `position` is TEXT not INTEGER, the agent saves that gotcha. Next time, it knows.\n\n## Insights, Not Just Rows\n\nDash reasons about what makes an answer useful, not just technically correct.\n\n**Question:**\nWho won the most races in 2019?\n\n| Typical SQL Agent | Dash |\n|------------------|------|\n| `Hamilton: 11` | Lewis Hamilton dominated 2019 with **11 wins out of 21 races**, more than double Bottas’s 4 wins. This performance secured his sixth world championship. |\n\n## Deploy to Railway\n\n```sh\nrailway login\n\n./scripts/railway_up.sh\n```\n\n### Production Operations\n\n**Load data and knowledge:**\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_data\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_knowledge\n```\n\n**View logs:**\n\n```sh\nrailway logs --service dash\n```\n\n**Run commands in production:**\n\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash  # CLI mode\n```\n\n**Redeploy after changes:**\n\n```sh\nrailway up --service dash -d\n```\n\n**Open dashboard:**\n```sh\nrailway open\n```\n\n## Adding Knowledge\n\nDash works best when it understands how your organization talks about data.\n\n```\nknowledge/\n├── tables/      # Table meaning and caveats\n├── queries/     # Proven SQL patterns\n└── business/    # Metrics and language\n```\n\n### Table Metadata\n\n```\n{\n  \"table_name\": \"orders\",\n  \"table_description\": \"Customer orders with denormalized line items\",\n  \"use_cases\": [\"Revenue reporting\", \"Customer analytics\"],\n  \"data_quality_notes\": [\n    \"created_at is UTC\",\n    \"status values: pending, completed, refunded\",\n    \"amount stored in cents\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Query Patterns\n\n```\n-- <query name>monthly_revenue</query name>\n-- <query description>\n-- Monthly revenue calculation.\n-- Converts cents to dollars.\n-- Excludes refunded orders.\n-- </query description>",

DataClaw lets you throw the ladder back down. The dataset it produces is yours to share.\n\nTurn your Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and OpenClaw conversation history into structured data and publish it to Hugging Face with a single command. DataClaw parses session logs, redacts secrets and PII, and uploads the result as a ready-to-use dataset.\n\n![DataClaw](dataclaw.jpeg)\n\nEvery export is tagged **`dataclaw`** on Hugging Face.

See how FastCode analyzes complex codebases with lightning speed.\n\n---\n\n</div>\n\n### Core Technologies Behind FastCode\n\nFastCode introduces a three-phase framework that transforms how LLMs understand and navigate codebases:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"assets/framework.png\" alt=\"FastCode Framework\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</p>\n\n## 🏗️ Semantic-Structural Code Representation\n\n### Multi-layered codebase understanding for comprehensive analysis\n\n- **🔍 Hierarchical Code Units** — Advanced multi-level indexing spanning files, classes, functions, and documentation using AST-based parsing across 8+ programming languages\n\n- **🔗 Hybrid Index** — Seamlessly combines semantic embeddings with keyword search (BM25) for robust and precise code retrieval\n\n- **📊 Multi-Layer Graph Modeling** — Three interconnected relationship graphs (Call Graph, Dependency Graph, Inheritance Graph) enabling structural navigation across the entire codebase\n\n### 🧭 Lightning-Fast Codebase Navigation\n\nFinding the right code without opening every file - at lightning speed\n\n- **⚡ Two-Stage Smart Search** — Like having a research assistant that first finds potentially relevant code, then ranks and organizes the best matches for your specific question.\n\n- **📁 Safe File Browsing** — Explores your project structure securely, understanding folder organization and file patterns without compromising security.\n\n- **🌐 Following Code Connections** — Traces how code pieces connect (up to 2 steps away), like following a trail of breadcrumbs through your codebase.\n\n- **🎯 Code Skimming** — Instead of reading entire files, FastCode just looks at the \"headlines\" - function names, class definitions, and type hints. This is like reading a book's chapter titles instead of every page, saving massive amounts of processing power.\n\n#",

      "readme": "# OpenPlanter\n\nA recursive-language-model investigation agent with a terminal UI. OpenPlanter ingests heterogeneous datasets — corporate registries, campaign finance records, lobbying disclosures, government contracts, and more — resolves entities across them, and surfaces non-obvious connections through evidence-backed analysis. It operates autonomously with file I/O, shell execution, web search, and recursive sub-agent delegation.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```bash\n# Install\npip install -e .\n\n# Configure API keys (interactive prompt)\nopenplanter-agent --configure-keys\n\n# Launch the TUI\nopenplanter-agent --workspace /path/to/your/project\n```\n\nOr run a single task headlessly:\n\n```bash\nopenplanter-agent --task \"Cross-reference vendor payments against lobbying disclosures and flag overlaps\" --workspace ./data\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```bash\n# Add your API keys to .env, then:\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nThe container mounts `./workspace` as the agent's working directory.\n\n## Supported Providers\n\n| Provider | Default Model | Env Var |\n|----------|---------------|---------|\n| OpenAI | `gpt-5.2` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |\n| Anthropic | `claude-opus-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |\n| OpenRouter | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |\n| Cerebras | `qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` |\n| Ollama | `llama3.2` | (none — local) |\n\n### Local Models (Ollama)\n\n[Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs models locally with no API key. Install Ollama, pull a model (`ollama pull llama3.2`), then:\n\n```bash\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama --model mistral\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama --list-models\n```\n\nThe base URL defaults to `http://localhost:11434/v1` and can be overridden with `OPENPLANTER_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` or `--base-url`. The first request may be slow while Ollama loads the model into memory; a 120-second first-byte timeout is used automatically.\n\nAdditional service keys: `EXA_API_KEY` (web search), `VOYAGE_API_KEY` (embeddings).\n\nAll keys can also be set with an `OPENPLANTER_` prefix (e.g. `OPENPLANTER_OPENAI_API_KEY`), via `.env` files in the workspace, or via CLI flags.\n\n## Agent Tools\n\nThe agent has access to 19 tools, organized around its investigation workflow:\n\n**Dataset ingestion & workspace** — `list_files`, `search_files`, `repo_map`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `hashline_edit`, `apply_patch` — load, inspect, and transform source datasets; write structured findings.\n\n**Shell execution** — `run_shell`, `run_shell_bg`, `check_shell_bg`, `kill_shell_bg` — run analysis scripts, data pipelines, and validation checks.\n\n**Web** — `web_search` (Exa), `fetch_url` — pull public records, verify entities, and retrieve supplementary data.\n\n**Planning & delegation** — `think`, `subtask`, `execute`, `list_artifacts`, `read_artifact` — decompose investigations into focused sub-tasks, each with acceptance criteria and independent verification.\n\nIn **recursive mode** (the default), the agent spawns sub-agents via `subtask` and `execute` to parallelize entity resolution, cross-dataset linking, and evidence-chain construction across large investigations.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```\nopenplanter-agent [options]\n```\n\n### Workspace & Session\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--workspace DIR` | Workspace root (default: `.`) |\n| `--session-id ID` | Use a specific session ID |\n| `--resume` | Resume the latest (or specified) session |\n| `--list-sessions` | List saved sessions and exit |\n\n### Model Selection\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--provider NAME` | `auto`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `cerebras`, `ollama` |\n| `--model NAME` | Model name or `newest` to auto-select |\n| `--reasoning-effort LEVEL` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `none` |\n| `--list-models` | Fetch available models from the provider API |\n\n### Execution\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--task OBJECTIVE` | Run a single task and exit (headless) |\n| `--recursive` | Enable recursive sub-agent delegation |\n| `--acceptance-criteria` | Judge subtask results with a lightweight model |\n| `--max-depth N` | Maximum recursion depth (default: 4) |\n| `--max-steps N` | Maximum steps per call (default: 100) |\n| `--timeout N` | Shell command timeout in seconds (default: 45) |\n\n### UI\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--no-tui` | Plain REPL (no colors or spinner) |\n| `--headless` | Non-interactive mode (for CI) |\n| `--demo` | Censor entity names and workspace paths in output |\n\n### Persistent Defaults\n\nUse `--default-model`, `--default-reasoning-effort`, or per-provider variants like `--default-model-openai` to save workspace defaults to `.openplanter/settings.json`. View them with `--show-settings`.\n\n## TUI Commands\n\nInside the interactive REPL:\n\n| Command | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| `/model` | Show current model and provider |\n| `/model NAME` | Switch model (aliases: `opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt5`, etc.) |\n| `/model NAME --save` | Switch and persist as default |\n| `/mod",

Keep your facts.\"*\n\n**Cut your AI agent's token spend in half.** One command compresses your entire workspace — memory files, session transcripts, sub-agent context — using 5 layered compression techniques. Deterministic. Mostly lossless. No LLM required.\n\n## Features\n- **5 compression layers** working in sequence for maximum savings\n- **Zero LLM cost** — all compression is rule-based and deterministic\n- **Lossless roundtrip** for dictionary, RLE, and rule-based compression\n- **~97% savings** on session transcripts via observation extraction\n- **Tiered summaries** (L0/L1/L2) for progressive context loading\n- **CJK-aware** — full Chinese/Japanese/Korean support\n- **One command** (`full`) runs everything in optimal order\n\n## 5 Compression Layers\n| 1 | Rule engine | Dedup lines, strip markdown filler, merge sections | 4-8% | |\n| 2 | Dictionary encoding | Auto-learned codebook, `$XX` substitution | 4-5% | |\n| 3 | Observation compression | Session JSONL → structured summaries | ~97% | * |\n| 4 | RLE patterns | Path shorthand (`$WS`), IP prefix, enum compaction | 1-2% | |\n| 5 | Compressed Context Protocol | ultra/medium/light abbreviation | 20-60% | * |\n\n\\*Lossy techniques preserve all facts and decisions; only verbose formatting is removed.\n\n## Quick Start\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/aeromomo/claw-compactor.git\ncd claw-compactor\n\n# See how much you'd save (non-destructive)\npython3 scripts/mem_compress.py /path/to/workspace benchmark\n\n# Compress everything\npython3 scripts/mem_compress.py /path/to/workspace full\n```\n\n**Requirements:** Python 3.9+.

What about you? \n\nI have a feeling you see it the same way, so let’s run it.\n\n## Important notice\n\nThis software is a **copy-trading bot** that replicates positions from a chosen wallet on Polymarket. The current release (v1) does not include built-in strategy logic, risk controls, or guarantees of profitability. Outcomes depend on the tracked wallet, your sizing, and market conditions. You can extend or adapt the code to implement your own risk and strategy layers. A newer version exists but is not publicly released; updates and support will continue to be provided over time.\n\n### Contact\n- [Discussions](../../discussions)\n- [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/16286666724?text=Hello%20there)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/angel_10_x)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/users/1114372741672488990)\n\n## Why python?\n\nI still remember the moment I decided to build my Polymarket bot.\n\nAt first, I stood at the familiar crossroads every developer knows too well ' which language should I trust with something that needed to be fast, reliable, and intelligent? TypeScript tempted me with its structured ecosystem and rich tooling. Other languages promised performance or strict type guarantees. But none of them felt like the right companion for the journey I was about to begin.\n\nBecause this wasn't just another script.\n\nThis was a living system ' a bot that would observe markets, interpret signals, adapt to uncertainty, and act with precision in a space where probabilities shift like tides.\n\nAnd that is why I chose Python.\n\nPython didn't just offer syntax; it offered *flow*. The code felt like thought translated directly into action. When I began wiring together market data ingestion, event interpretation, and strategy logic, Python allowed me to move at the speed of curiosity. Ideas became prototypes in minutes. Strategies evolved overnight. Refactors felt like gentle edits rather than structural battles.\n\nBut the deeper reason was intelligence.\n\nBuilding a Polymarket bot is not merely about sending transactions, it's about understanding context. Parsing sentiment, modeling probabilities, experimenting with reinforcement signals, and testing hypotheses rapidly. Python's ecosystem placed an entire laboratory at my fingertips: data analysis tools, statistical libraries, async frameworks, and machine learning capabilities that transformed the project from a trading bot into an experimental platform.\n\nTypeScript could orchestrate APIs elegantly.\nPython could help me *think*.\n\nThere was also a quiet comfort in Python's readability. Weeks later, when strategies became layered and decision paths intertwined, I could still open a file and understand my past self. The code read like notes from a conversation rather than instructions carved in stone. That clarity made iteration fearless.\n\nAnd iteration is survival in prediction markets.\n\nPython also became the bridge between research and execution. I could simulate strategies, visualize outcomes, tweak assumptions, and immediately embed those insights back into the bot's runtime behavior. The boundary between experimentation and production dissolved.\n\nWhat surprised me most, though, was the emotional dimension.\n\nLate nights debugging WebSocket streams, watching probabilities flicker, seeing the first autonomous trade execute successfully ' Python made those moments feel collaborative rather than adversarial. The language faded into the background, leaving only the problem space and my curiosity.\n\nThe Polymarket bot eventually became more than automation.\nIt became a narrative of decisions, risks, and evolving understanding.\n\nChoosing Python was not about rejecting TypeScript or other languages. It was about selecting the medium that best matched the nature of the problem ' dynamic, exploratory, data-driven, and adaptive.\n\nIn the end, Python didn't just power the bot.\n\nIt powered the process of discovery that made the bot possible.\n\n\n## Setup\n\n1. **Install dependencies**\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **Environment**\n\n   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Polymarket credentials:\n\n   ```\n   POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key\n   POLYMARKET_PROXY_ADDRESS=your_proxy_address\n   ```\n\n3. **Config**\n\n   Create or edit `config.json` in the project root:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n       \"wallets_to_track\": [\"0x...\"],\n       \"copy_percentage\": 1.0,\n       \"rate_limit\": 25,\n       \"poll_interval\": 0.5,\n       \"trading_enabled\": true\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Configuration options\n\n| Option              | Description                                                                 |\n|---------------------|--------------------",

      "readme": "# Desloppify - an agent harness to make your codebase 🤌\n\n[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/desloppify)](https://pypi.org/project/desloppify/) ![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue)\n\nDesloppify gives your AI coding agent the tools to identify, understand, and systematically improve codebase quality. It combines mechanical detection (dead code, duplication, complexity) with subjective LLM review (naming, abstractions, module boundaries), then works through a prioritized fix loop. State persists across scans so it chips away over multiple sessions, and the scoring is designed to resist gaming.\n\n<img src=\"assets/explained.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\nThe score gives your agent a north-star, and the tooling helps it plan, execute, and resolve issues until it hits your target — with a lot of tricks to keep it on track. A score above 98 should correlate with a codebase a seasoned engineer would call beautiful.\n\nThat score generates a scorecard badge for your GitHub profile or README:\n\n<img src=\"assets/scorecard.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\nCurrently supports 28 languages — full plugin depth for TypeScript, Python, C#, Dart, GDScript, and Go; generic linter + tree-sitter support for Rust, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, and 17 more.\n\n## For your agent's consideration...\n\nPaste this prompt into your agent:\n\n```\nI want you to improve the quality of this codebase. To do this, install and run desloppify.\nRun ALL of the following (requires Python 3.11+):\n\npip install --upgrade \"desloppify[full]\"\ndesloppify update-skill claude    # IMPORTANT — installs the workflow guide. Pick yours: claude, cursor, codex, copilot, windsurf, gemini\ndesloppify scan --path .\ndesloppify next\n\n--path is the directory to scan (use \".\" for the whole project, or \"src/\" etc).\n\nYour goal is to get the strict score that Desloppify produces as high as possible. Don't be lazy. Fix things properly\nand fix things deep. Large refactors are fine if that's what it takes but also small fixes are great. The scoring is designed\nto resist gaming, so the only way to improve it is to actually make the code better. Don't cheat.\n\nFollow `next` — it tells you exactly what to fix, which file, and the resolve command to run\nwhen done. Fix the issue, resolve it, run `next` again. Keep going until done.\nUse `plan` to reorder priorities or cluster related issues.\nYou can scan to refresh things. The scan output includes agent instructions — follow them, don't augment with your own analysis but follow its plan.\n```\n\n## From Vibe Coding to Vibe Engineering\n\nVibe coding gets things built fast. But the codebases it produces tend to rot in ways that are hard to see and harder to fix — not just the mechanical stuff like dead imports, but the structural kind. Abstractions that made sense at first stop making sense. Naming drifts. Error handling is done three different ways. The codebase works, but working in it gets worse over time.\n\nLLMs are actually good at spotting this now, if you ask them the right questions. That's the core bet here — that an agent with the right framework can hold a codebase to a real standard, the kind that used to require a senior engineer paying close attention over months.\n\nSo we're trying to define what \"good\" looks like as a score that's actually worth optimizing. Not a lint score you game to 100 by suppressing warnings. Something where improving the number means the codebase genuinely got better. That's hard, and we're not done, but the anti-gaming stuff matters to us a lot — it's the difference between a useful signal and a vanity metric.\n\nThe hope is that anyone can use this to build something a seasoned engineer would look at and respect. That's the bar we're aiming for.\n\nIf you'd like to join a community of vibe engineers who want to build beautiful things, [come hang out](https://discord.gg/aZdzbZrHaY).\n\n<img src=\"assets/engineering.png\" width=\"100%\">\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Stuff you probably won't need to know</strong></summary>\n\n#### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `scan [--reset-subjective]` | Run all detectors, update state (optional: reset subjective baseline to 0 first) |\n| `status` | Score + per-tier progress |\n| `show <pattern>` | Findings by file, directory, detector, or ID |\n| `next [--tier N] [--explain]` | Highest-priority open finding (--explain: with score context) |\n| `resolve <status> <patterns>` | Mark open / fixed / wontfix / false_positive |\n| `fix <fixer> [--dry-run]` | Auto-fix mechanical issues |\n| `review --prepare` | Generate subjective review packet (`query.json`) |\n| `review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel` | Run blind subjective batch assessments, merge/import, optionally `--scan-after-import` |\n| `review --import <file> [--allow-partial]` | Import subjective review findings (fails closed on invalid findings by default) |\n| `review --external-start --external-runner claude` | Start Claude cloud blind-review session (creates session/token/template) |\n| `re",

might work on other apple silicon macs but no guarantees\n\n## how it works\n\nthe sensor lives under AppleSPUHIDDevice in the iokit registry, on vendor usage page 0xFF00.\nusage 3 is the accelerometer, usage 9 is the gyroscope (same physical IMU, believed to be Bosch BMI286 based on teardowns).\nthe driver is AppleSPUHIDDriver which is part of the sensor processing unit.\nwe open it with IOHIDDeviceCreate and register an asynchronous callback via IOHIDDeviceRegisterInputReportCallback.\ndata comes as 22-byte hid reports with x/y/z as int32 little-endian at byte offsets 6, 10, 14.\ndivide by 65536 to get the value in g (accel) or deg/s (gyro).\ncallback rate is ~100hz (decimated from ~800hz native)\n\norientation is computed by fusing accel + gyro with a Mahony AHRS quaternion filter and displayed as roll/pitch/yaw gauges\n\nyou can verify the device exists on your machine with:\n\n    ioreg -l -w0 | grep -A5 AppleSPUHIDDevice\n\n## install (beta API)\n\n    pip install macimu\n\nif you get `externally-managed-environment` (homebrew python), use a venv:\n\n    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install macimu\n\n```python\nfrom macimu import IMU\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with IMU() as imu:\n        accel = imu.latest_accel()       # Sample(x, y, z) in g\n        gyro = imu.latest_gyro()         # Sample(x, y, z) in deg/s\n\n        for s in imu.read_accel():       # all new samples since last call\n            print(s.x, s.y, s.z)\n```\n\nrequires root (sudo) because iokit hid device access needs elevated privileges.\nnote: accelerometer reads ~1g at rest (gravity). use `macimu.filters.remove_gravity()` to isolate dynamic acceleration.\n\n### check if sensor exists (no root needed)\n\n```python\nfrom macimu import IMU\nprint(IMU.available())   # True on macbook pro m2+\n```\n\n### real-time orientation (roll / pitch / yaw)\n\nfuses accel + gyro with a mahony quaternion filter, no math needed on your side\n\n```python\nfrom macimu import IMU\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with IMU(orientation=True) as imu:\n        o = imu.orientation()\n        print(f\"{o.roll:.1f}° {o.pitch:.1f}° {o.yaw:.1f}°\")\n        print(o.qw, o.qx, o.qy, o.qz)  # raw quaternion\n```\n\n### timestamped samples (hardware timestamps from iokit)\n\neach sample includes a precise timestamp from the hid report (mach_absolute_time),\nnot a python-side clock. every report gets its own unique timestamp.\n\n```python\nfrom macimu import IMU\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with IMU() as imu:\n        for s in imu.read_accel_timed():\n            print(f\"t={s.t:.6f}  x={s.x:.3f}  y={s.y:.3f}  z={s.z:.3f}\")\n```\n\n### streaming with callback\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom macimu import IMU\n\ndef on_sample(s):\n    print(s.x, s.y, s.z)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with IMU() as imu:\n        stop = imu.on_accel(on_sample)  # background thread\n        time.sleep(10)\n        stop()                          # unregister\n```\n\n### sample rate control\n\n```python\nIMU(sample_rate=200)  # ~200 hz (preferred way)\nIMU(sample_rate=50)   # ~50 hz\nIMU(decimation=1)     # ~800 hz (full native rate)\nIMU(decimation=8)     # ~100 hz (default)\n```\n\n### signal processing (zero-dependency biquad butterworth filters)\n\n```python\nfrom macimu import IMU\nfrom macimu.filters import magnitude, remove_gravity, high_pass, low_pass, peak_detect\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with IMU() as imu:\n        samples = imu.read_accel()\n        m = magnitude(samples[0].x, samples[0].y, samples[0].z)\n        dynamic = remove_gravity(samples)               # kalman filter gravity removal\n        smooth = low_pass(samples, 5.0, 100.0)          # 2nd-order butterworth\n        taps = high_pass(samples, 10.0, 100.0, order=4) # 4th-order, -24 dB/oct\n        mags = [magnitude(s.x, s.y, s.z) for s in samples]\n        hits = peak_detect(mags, threshold=1.2)          # detect impacts\n```\n\n### mock mode (no root ne",
