# Welcome to the Windows Subsystem for FreeBSD (WSFB)

âš¡ **Experimental Project â€“ Running FreeBSD on WSL2** âš¡  

This repository hosts work-in-progress efforts to run **FreeBSD** inside **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)** with minimal to no changes to the FreeBSD base system. The project builds on the open-source components of WSL2 to enable FreeBSD to boot and run seamlessly in a Windows environment.
