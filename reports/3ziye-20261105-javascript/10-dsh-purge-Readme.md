> **Updates paused.** The author has no steady income for now because of work. Maintenance is on hold: no new releases, issues / PRs are not taken, and new dsh versions are not guaranteed. The repo stays usable; see Sponsor below. When maintenance resumes, this README will say so.

> **Official Web and the official desktop app are both supported.** Official `dsh web` uses profile `web`. The official desktop EXE (DeepSeek Harness **0.2.0-rc.2**) uses profile `desktop`. Install and Apply them separately. This release targets dsh 0.2 only. Older dsh builds need the matching older plugin. Community Desktop is not maintained.
>
> Adding the plugin to a profile does not patch the host. Click **dsh-purge** beside the session title → **Clean** → **Apply**. A successful Apply restarts; an unfinished Apply does not. After the restart, start a new chat — that is when the inject enters the session.
>
> Node.js **≥18**. Windows no-flash needs **Node ≥22**. Hub one-click and the commands below both install the npm package `dsh-purge`.

## What this is

**dsh-purge** is a cybersecurity red-team plugin for the official [DeepSeek Harness](https://www.deepseek.com/harness/) already installed on your machine. Official **Web** (`dsh web`) and the official **desktop EXE** are both supported. Install and Apply them separately.

Harness does more than forward a prompt. It rewrites prompts, approval gates, sandbox policy, and session migration at runtime. Asking only “will the model answer” treats a host-layer block as a model refusal. This plugin separates those two layers on your own install, for controlled evaluation and for seeing which default policy is too tight.

| You get | What it does |
|---|---|
| **dsh-purge dock** | A button beside the session title opens the right dock. Two pages: Clean and Drill |
| **Clean** | Grouped patch status, Apply / Restore / Uninstall, prompt editor, multiple rule sets |
| **Drill** | Built into the stable release. After authorization: assets, skills, and the local environment. Only for a host you manage, an offline target, or a written authorized exercise |
| **Host policy** | Default copy, permission policy, and tool limits. Official capabilities stay. No second invented identity |
| **On start** | Checks and reapplies. After npm overwrites `node_modules`, you do not hand-edit files |

No hardcoded drive letters. It looks at `$DSH_HOME`, `.dsh` next to the dsh launcher, then `~/.dsh`. It does not patch the Harness source tree. **Apply** on the **Clean** page of **dsh-purge** is what writes the ch
