# Welcome to the Windows Subsystem for FreeBSD (WSFB)

âš¡ **Experimental Project â€“ Running FreeBSD on WSL2** âš¡  

This repository hosts work-in-progress efforts to run **FreeBSD** inside **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)** with minimal to no changes to the FreeBSD base system. The project builds on the open-source components of WSL2 to enable FreeBSD to boot and run seamlessly in a Windows environment.

---

## Project Goals

- Enable FreeBSD to run natively on WSL2â€™s architecture  
- Make minimal or no modifications to the FreeBSD base system  
- Contribute improvements back to open-source components where possible  

---

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** â€“ This is an experimental personal project.  

- FreeBSD boots successfully inside WSL2  
- Basic functionality is up and running  
- Ongoing work focuses on networking, I/O, and process management

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- [x] Initial boot support (done experimentally) 
- [x] Full Console Support executing Commands
