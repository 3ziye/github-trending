## Why Shim?

Model-agnostic coding agents are everywhere. Setting them up is still too hard: provider IDs, API endpoints, MCP JSON, skills directories, and a new interface for every tool.

**Shim is the small adapter between you and all of that.**

- **Talk or type commands.** A full scriptable CLI for experts; ordinary language for everyone else.
- **Use a local mini-model as the command router.** It translates management requests into an allowlisted command. Mutating commands require confirmation.
- **Bring any model API.** Native OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic adapters, plus presets for popular hosted and local providers.
- **Bring any MCP server or Agent Skill.** MCP over stdio and Streamable HTTP; lazy `SKILL.md` loading from common directories.
- **Stay light.** No Electron, Node, Python, Docker, database, background daemon, or UI framework.
- **Own your state.** Plain JSON config and JSONL sessions. API keys come from environment variables and are never written to Shim's config.

Measured on the maintainer's Windows machine for v0.1.0: **7.29 MiB** stripped binary and **9.96 ms median** process startup for `shim --version` over 30 runs. This is a local measurement, not a cross-platform performance guarantee.

## Install

### Download

Get a static binary for Windows, macOS, or Linux from [Releases](https://github.com/Balanov/shim/releases), put it on your `PATH`, then run:

```sh
shim setup
shim
```

On PowerShell, use `.\shim.exe` when running the binary from the current directory.

### With Go

Go 1.25+:

```sh
go install github.com/Balanov/shim/cmd/shim@v0.1.0
shim setup
```

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Balanov/shim.git
cd shim
go test ./...
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-s -w" -o shim ./cmd/shim
./shim setup
```

Windows also has `scripts/build.ps1`; Unix has `scripts/build.sh`.

## Two ways to use it

### Just talk

```text
you › найди локальные модели
↳ /discover --add
Run this command? [y/N] y

you › show my tools
↳ /tools

you › fix the failing tests in this repository
```

Shim has deterministic offline phrases for common English and Russian management commands. For other languages, assign a local model as the router:

```sh
shim router use ollama/qwen3:4b
```

The router sees non-command chat text so it can distinguish configuration requests from agent tasks. Use a loopback model if you want that step to stay on your machine. **No model weights are bundled or silently downloaded**; that would defeat the tiny-binary goal. Your primary model handles ordinary conversation in whatever language it supports.

### Use the complete CLI

```sh
# Local models: discover and configure all running servers
shim model discover --add

# Hosted models
shim model add openrouter anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 --name claude --use
shim model add openai gpt-5 --name gpt --use
shim model add huggingface org/model --name hf --use

# Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
shim model add custom my-model --name mine \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1 --use

# One-shot agent run
shim run --read-only "explain this repository"
shim run --yes --verbose "fix the tests and verify the result"

# Interactive terminal
shim
```

Run `shim help` for the full command surface.

## Model providers

| Preset | Adapter | Credential environment variable |
|---|---|---|
| `ollama` | OpenAI-compatible | None |
| `lmstudio` | OpenAI-compatible | None |
| `llamacpp` | OpenAI-compatible | None |
| `openai` | OpenAI-compatible | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | OpenAI-compatible | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | Gemini OpenAI-compatible endpoint | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `github` | GitHub Models | `GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| `huggingface` | Hugging Face router | `HF_TOKEN` |
| `custom` | OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic | Optional, configurable |

“Any model” means any model exposed through a supported HTTP API. GGUF and other local weights run through Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, or another compatible inference server; Shim is the harness, not an inference engine.

PowerShell example:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "..."
shim model add openrouter your/model --name main --use
shim model test main
```
