## Install

Inside a Claude Code instance, run the following commands:

**Step 1: Add the marketplace**
```
/plugin marketplace add jarrodwatts/claude-hud
```

**Step 2: Install the plugin**

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Linux users: Click here first</strong></summary>

On Linux, `/tmp` is often a separate filesystem (tmpfs), which causes plugin installation to fail with:
```
EXDEV: cross-device link not permitted
```

**Fix**: Set TMPDIR before installing:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cache/tmp && TMPDIR=~/.cache/tmp claude
```

Then run the install command below in that session. This is a [Claude Code platform limitation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14799).

</details>

```
/plugin install claude-hud
```

**Step 3: Configure the statusline**
```
/claude-hud:setup
```

Done! The HUD appears immediately — no restart needed.

## What is Claude HUD?

Claude HUD gives you better insights into what's happening in your Claude Code session.

| What You See | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Project path** | Know which project you're in (configurable 1-3 directory levels) |
| **Context health** | Know exactly how full your context window is before it's too late |
| **Tool activity** | Watch Claude read, edit, and search files as it happens |
| **Agent tracking** | See which subagents are running and what they're doing |
| **Todo progress** | Track task completion in real-time |

## What Each Line Shows

### Session Info
```
[Opus | Pro] █████░░░░░ 45% | my-project git:(main) | 2 CLAUDE.md | 5h: 25% | ⏱️ 5m
```
- **Model** — Current model in use (shown first)
- **Plan name** — Your subscription tier (Pro, Max, Team) when usage enabled
- **Context bar** — Visual meter with color coding (green → yellow → red as it fills)
- **Project path** — Configurable 1-3 directory levels (default: 1)
- **Git branch** — Current branch name (configurable on/off)
- **Config counts** — CLAUDE.md files, rules, MCPs, and hooks loaded
- **Usage limits** — 5-hour rate limit percentage (opt-in, Pro/Max/Team only)
- **Duration** — How long the session has been running

### Tool Activity
```
✓ TaskOutput ×2 | ✓ mcp_context7 ×1 | ✓ Glob ×1 | ✓ Skill ×1
```
- **Running tools** show a spinner with the target file
- **Completed tools** aggregate by type with counts

### Agent Status
```
✓ Explore: Explore home directory structure (5s)
✓ open-source-librarian: Research React hooks patterns (2s)
```
- **Agent type** and what it's working on
- **Elapsed time** for each agent

### Todo Progress
```
✓ All todos complete (5/5)
```
- **Current task** or completion status
- **Progress counter** (completed/total)

## How It Works

Claude HUD uses Claude Code's native **statusline API** — no separate window, no tmux required, works in any terminal.

```
Claude Code → stdin JSON → claude-hud → stdout → displayed in your terminal
           ↘ transcript JSONL (tools, agents, todos)
```

**Key features:**
- Native token data from Claude Code (not estimated)
- Parses the transcript for tool/agent activity
- Updates every ~300ms

## Configuration

Customize your HUD anytime:

```
/claude-hud:configure
```

The guided flow walks you through customization — no manual editing needed:

- **First time setup**: Choose a preset (Full/Essential/Minimal), then fine-tune individual elements
- **Customize anytime**: Toggle items on/off, adjust git display style, switch layouts
- **Preview before saving**: See exactly how your HUD will look before committing changes

### Presets

| Preset | What's Shown |
|--------|--------------|
| **Full** | Everything enabled — tools, agents, todos, git, usage, duration |
| **Essential** | Activity lines + git status, minimal info clutter |
| **Minimal** | Core only — just model name and context bar |

After choosing a preset, you can turn individual elements on or off.

### Manual Configuration

You can also edit the config file directly at `~/.claude/plugins/claude-hud/config.json`.

| `pathLevels` | 1-3 | 1 | Directory levels to show in project path |
| `gitStatus.enabled` | boolean | true | Show git branch in HUD |
| `gitStatus.showDirty` | boolean | true | Show `*` for uncommitted changes |
| `gitStatus.showAheadBehind` | boolean | false | Show `↑N ↓N` for ahead/behind remote |
