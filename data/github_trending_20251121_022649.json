The workspace packages multiple OCR backends, prompt tooling, and a serving layer so you can build document understanding pipelines that run locally on CPU, Apple Metal, or (alpha) NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.\n\n> 中文文档请看 [README_CN.md](README_CN.md)。  \n\n> Want ready-made binaries? Latest macOS (Metal-enabled) and Windows bundles live in the [build-binaries workflow artifacts](https://github.com/TimmyOVO/deepseek-ocr.rs/actions/workflows/build-binaries.yml). Grab them from the newest green run.\n\n## Choosing a Model 🔬\n\n| Model | Memory footprint* | Best on | When to pick it |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **DeepSeek‑OCR** | **≈6.3GB** FP16 weights, **≈13GB** RAM/VRAM with cache & activations (512-token budget) | Apple Silicon + Metal (FP16), high-VRAM NVIDIA GPUs, 32GB+ RAM desktops | Highest accuracy, SAM+CLIP global/local context, MoE DeepSeek‑V2 decoder (3B params, ~570M active per token). Use when latency is secondary to quality. |\n| **PaddleOCR‑VL** | **≈4.7GB** FP16 weights, **≈9GB** RAM/VRAM with cache & activations | 16GB laptops, CPU-only boxes, mid-range GPUs | Dense 0.9B Ernie decoder with SigLIP vision tower. Faster startup, lower memory, great for batch jobs or lightweight deployments. |\n| **DotsOCR** | **≈9GB** FP16 weights, but expect **30–50GB** RAM/VRAM for high-res docs due to huge vision tokens | Apple Silicon + Metal BF16, ≥24GB CUDA cards, or 64GB RAM CPU workstations | Unified VLM (DotsVision + Qwen2) that nails layout, reading order, grounding, and multilingual math if you can tolerate the latency and memory bill. |\n\n\\*Measured from the default FP16 safetensors. Runtime footprint varies with sequence length.\n\nGuidance:\n\n- **Need maximum fidelity, multi-region reasoning, or already have 16–24GB VRAM?** Use **DeepSeek‑OCR**. The hybrid SAM+CLIP tower plus DeepSeek‑V2 MoE decoder handles complex layouts best, but expect higher memory/latency.\n- **Deploying to CPU-only nodes, 16GB laptops, or latency-sensitive services?** Choose **PaddleOCR‑VL**. Its dense Ernie decoder (18 layers, hidden 1024) activates fewer parameters per token and keeps memory under 10GB while staying close in quality on most docs.\n- **Chasing reading-order accuracy, layout grounding, or multi-page multilingual PDFs on roomy hardware?** Pick **DotsOCR** with BF16 on Metal/CUDA. Prefill runs around 40–50 tok/s on M-series GPUs but can fall to ~12 tok/s on CPU because of the heavy vision tower.\n\n## Why Rust? 💡\n\nThe original DeepSeek-OCR ships as a Python + Transformers stack—powerful, but hefty to deploy and awkward to embed. Rewriting the pipeline in Rust gives us:\n\n- Smaller deployable artifacts with zero Python runtime or conda baggage.\n- Memory-safe, thread-friendly infrastructure that blends into native Rust backends.\n- Unified tooling (CLI + server) running on Candle + Rocket without the Python GIL overhead.\n- Drop-in compatibility with OpenAI-style clients while tuned for single-turn OCR prompts.\n\n## Technical Stack ⚙️\n\n- **Candle** for tensor compute, with Metal and CUDA backends and FlashAttention support.\n- **Rocket** + async streaming for OpenAI-compatible `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.\n- **tokenizers** (upstream DeepSeek release) wrapped by `crates/assets` for deterministic caching via Hugging Face and ModelScope mirrors.\n- **Pure Rust vision/prompt pipeline** shared by CLI and server to avoid duplicated logic.\n\n## Advantages over the Python Release 🥷\n\n- Faster cold-start on Apple Silicon, lower RSS, and native binary distribution.\n- Deterministic dual-source (Hugging Face + ModelScope) asset download + verification built into the workspace.\n- Automatic single-turn chat compaction so OCR outputs stay stable even when clients send history.\n- Ready-to-use OpenAI compatibility for tools like Open WebUI without adapters.\n\n## Highlights ✨\n\n- **One repo, two entrypoints** – a batteries-included CLI for batch jobs and a Rocket-based server that speaks `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.\n- **Works out of the box** – pulls model weights, configs, and tokenizer from whichever of Hugging Face or ModelScope responds fastest on first run.\n- **Optimised for Apple Silicon** – optional Metal backend with FP16 execution for real-time OCR on laptops.\n- **CUDA (alpha)** – experimental support via `--features cuda` + `--device cuda --dtype f16`; expect rough edges while we finish kernel coverage.\n- **Intel MKL (preview)** – faster BLAS on x86 via `--features mkl` (install Intel oneMKL beforehand).\n- **OpenAI client compatibility** – drop-in replacement for popular SDKs; the server automatically collapses chat history to the latest user turn for OCR-friendly prompts.\n\n## Model Matrix 📦\n\nThe workspace exposes three base model IDs plus DSQ-quantized variants for DeepSeek‑OCR, PaddleOCR‑VL, and DotsOCR:\n\n| Model ID | Base Model | Precision | Suggested Use Case |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `deepsee",

It works for basic use cases but hasn't been thoroughly tested. Things might break, APIs might change, and there are probably bugs. Tested primarily on macOS – not sure if it works properly on Linux and Windows due to webview differences.\n\n## About\n\nPipedash aggregates CI/CD pipelines from multiple providers into a single desktop interface. Instead of switching between GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Buildkite, Jenkins, and Tekton dashboards, view everything in one place.\n\nBuilt with Tauri, Rust, React, and TypeScript.\n\n## Why\n\nMost development teams use multiple CI/CD platforms over time. Open source projects often use GitHub Actions, internal services might run on GitLab CI or Buildkite, Kubernetes-native workloads use Tekton, and there's usually some Jenkins instance handling legacy systems. Checking everything means opening multiple tabs and manually refreshing.\n\nThis tool pulls pipeline data from different providers and shows it together.\n\n## Supported Providers\n\n- GitHub Actions\n- GitLab CI\n- Buildkite\n- Jenkins\n- Tekton CD\n- ArgoCD\n\nThe plugin architecture allows adding more providers.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe app polls configured providers and displays pipelines organized by repository and workflow. Background refresh runs every X seconds (configurable per provider). When pipeline status changes, the UI updates automatically.\n\nMain capabilities:\n- View pipeline status across multiple providers\n- Browse run history with commit info and execution times\n- Trigger workflows with parameters dynamically loaded from each provider\n- Re-run previous executions with the same parameters\n- Cancel running builds\n- Multiple instances of the same provider type\n\nWhen triggering or re-running a workflow, the app fetches available parameters directly from the provider plugin (workflow inputs for GitHub Actions, pipeline variables for GitLab CI, build parameters for Jenkins and Buildkite, etc.) and displays them in a form.\n\n**Privacy First**\n\nEverything runs locally on the machine. The app only connects to configured CI/CD providers – no analytics, telemetry, or third-party services. Pipeline data is stored in a local SQLite database and API tokens are encrypted in the system keyring.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/hcavarsan/pipedash/releases).\n\nAvailable for macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n## Setup\n\nLaunch the app and add a provider via the sidebar. Each provider needs an API token:\n\n**GitHub Actions**: Personal Access Token with `repo` and `workflow` scopes. Optionally set a custom base URL for GitHub Enterprise.\n\n**GitLab CI**: Personal Access Token with `api` scope. Supports both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances.\n\n**Buildkite**: API Access Token with read permissions and the organization slug.\n\n**Jenkins**: API token, username, and server URL.\n\n**Tekton CD**: Kubernetes config file path and context. Automatically detects namespaces with Tekton pipelines.\n\n**ArgoCD**: Server URL and authentication token. Optionally filter by Git organizations. Monitors application sync status, health, and deployment history.\n\nAfter adding a provider, the app validates credentials and fetches available repositories. Select which ones to monitor and save. Pipelines will appear in the main view and refresh automatically.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Store**\n\nProvider configurations are stored in a local SQLite database. Tokens are kept separate in the system keyring.\n\nEach provider has its own refresh interval (default: 30 seconds), adjustable based on API rate limits.\n\n\n\n**Plugin System**\n\nEach CI/CD provider is implemented as a plugin that exposes a common interface. The core application doesn't know the specifics of how GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Buildkite, Jenkins, Tekton, or ArgoCD work—it just calls standard methods like `fetch_pipelines()` or `trigger_pipeline()` and the plugin handles the details.\n\nPlugins are compiled into the application at build time, not loaded dynamically at runtime. This keeps things simpler and avoids the security concerns of runtime plugin loading.\n\nWhen the app starts, it loads cached pipeline data from SQLite immediately. In the background, a refresh loop polls each provider's API and updates the cache when changes are detected. The frontend listens for events and re-renders when new data arrives.\n\n## Adding Providers\n\nTo add support for a new CI/CD platform, create a new crate in `crates/pipedash-plugin-{name}/` and implement the `Plugin` trait from `pipedash-plugin-api`. The trait defines methods for fetching pi",

Just as traditional filesystems provide file and directory abstractions for applications, AgentFS provides the storage abstractions that AI agents need.\n\nAgentFS provides four components:\n\n* **SDK** - [TypeScript](sdk/typescript) and [Rust](sdk/rust) libraries for programmatic filesystem access\n* **[CLI](MANUAL.md)** - Command-line interface for managing agent filesystems\n* **[Specification](SPEC.md)** - SQLite-based agent filesystem specification\n* **Sandbox** - Linux-compatible execution environment with agent filesystem support (_experimental_)\n\nRead more about the motivation for AgentFS in the announcement [blog post](https://turso.tech/blog/agentfs).\n## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started\n\n### Using the CLI\n\nInitialize an agent filesystem:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs init\nCreated agent filesystem: agent.db\n```\n\nInspect the agent filesystem from outside:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs fs ls\nf hello.txt\n\n$ agentfs fs cat hello.txt\nhello from agent\n```\n\nYou can also run a program in an experimental sandbox with the agent filesystem mounted at `/agent`:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs run /bin/bash\nWelcome to AgentFS!\n\n$ echo \"hello from agent\" > /agent/hello.txt\n$ cat /agent/hello.txt\nhello from agent\n$ exit\n```\n\nRead the **[User Manual](MANUAL.md)** for complete documentation.\n\n### Using the SDK\n\nInstall the SDK in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install agentfs-sdk\n```\n\nUse it in your agent code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AgentFS } from 'agentfs-sdk';\n\nconst agent = await AgentFS.open('./agent.db');\n\n// Key-value operations\nawait agent.kv.set('user:preferences', { theme: 'dark' });\nconst prefs = await agent.kv.get('user:preferences');\n\n// Filesystem operations\nawait agent.fs.writeFile('/output/report.pdf', pdfBuffer);\nconst files = await agent.fs.readdir('/output');\n\n// Tool call tracking\nawait agent.tools.record(\n  'web_search',\n  Date.now() / 1000,\n  Date.now() / 1000 + 1.5,\n  { query: 'AI' },\n  { results: [...] }\n);\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nAgentFS includes examples demonstrating integration with popular AI frameworks:\n\n- **[Mastra](examples/mastra/research-assistant)** - Research assistant using the Mastra AI framework\n- **[Claude Agent SDK](examples/claude-agent/research-assistant)** - Research assistant using Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK\n\nSee the **[examples](examples)** directory for more details.\n\n## 💡 Why AgentFS?\n\n**Auditability**: Every file operation, tool call, and state change is recorded in SQLite. Query your agent's complete history with SQL to debug issues, analyze behavior, or meet compliance requirements.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Snapshot an agent's state at any point with `cp agent.db snapshot.db`. Restore it later to reproduce exact execution states, test what-if scenarios, or roll back mistakes.\n\n**Portability**: The entire agent runtime—files, state, history —is stored in a single SQLite file. Move it between machines, check it into version control, or deploy it to any system where Turso runs.\n\n**Simplicity**: No configuration files, no database servers, no distributed systems. Just a single file and a simple API.\n\n**Sandboxing**: Run agents in an isolated Linux environment where filesystem access is controlled and monitored. Perfect for testing untrusted code or enforcing security policies.\n\n## 🔧 How AgentFS Works?\n\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"40%\" src=\".github/assets/agentfs-arch.svg\">\n\nAgentFS is an agent filesystem accessible through an SDK that provides three essential interfaces for agent state management:\n\n* **Filesystem:** A POSIX-like filesystem for files and directories\n* **Key-Value:** A key-value store for agent state and contex",

It serves as a free and open alternative to the proprietary **Miele Diagnostic Utility (MDU)** software, which is only available to registered service technicians.\n\nMost Miele devices manufactured after 1996 include an optical infrared-based diagnostic interface, hidden behind one of the indicator lights on the front panel. On older appliances, this interface is marked by a **Program Correction (PC)** label.\n\nUntil now, communication with this interface required an expensive infrared adapter sold exclusively by Miele, along with their closed-source software. The goal of FreeMDU is to make this interface accessible to everyone for diagnostic and home automation purposes.\n\nThe project is split into three main components:\n\n- [**Protocol**](protocol): core protocol library and device implementations\n- [**TUI**](tui): terminal-based device diagnostic and testing tool\n- [**Home**](home): communication adapter firmware with MQTT integration for Home Assistant\n\nMore details about the proprietary diagnostic interface and the reverse-engineering process behind this project can be found in this [**blog post**](https://medusalix.github.io/posts/miele-interface).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This project is highly experimental and can cause permanent damage to your Miele devices if not used responsibly. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n## Supported devices\n\nWhen a connection is established via the diagnostic interface, the appliance responds with its **software ID**, a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies the firmware version running on the device's microcontroller. However, this ID does not directly correspond to a specific model or board type, so it's impossible to provide a comprehensive list of supported models.\n\nThe following table lists the software IDs and device/board combinations that have been confirmed to work with FreeMDU:\n\n| Software ID | Device         | Board      | Microcontroller           | Optical interface location   | Status             |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 360         | Bare board     | EDPW 223-A | Mitsubishi M38078MC-065FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 419         | Bare board     | EDPW 206   | Mitsubishi M37451MC-804FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 605         | G 651 I PLUS-3 | EGPL 542-C | Mitsubishi M38027M8       | *Salt (PC)* indicator        | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 629         | W 2446         | EDPL 126-B | Mitsubishi M38079MF-308FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n\nIf your appliance is not listed here but has a model number similar to one of the above, it might already be compatible. In all other cases, determining the **software ID** is the first step toward adding support for new devices.\n\nDetails for adding support for new devices will be provided soon.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore using any FreeMDU components, make sure you have the [Rust toolchain](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.\n\nNext, you'll need to build a [communication adapter](home/README.md#getting-started) to interface with your Miele device. Once the adapter is ready, choose the appropriate use case from the options below:\n\n### Device diagnostics and testing\n\nIf you want to repair or test your appliance:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **bridge mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n2. Run the [TUI](tui) application on your desktop computer.\n\n### Integration into home automation systems\n\nIf you want to integrate your appliance into **Home Assistant** or another home automation system:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **standalone mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n### Building custom tools\n\nIf you want to develop your own software to communicate with Miele devices:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **bridge mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n2. Use the [protocol](protocol) crate to implement your custom software.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Miele & Cie.

Further updates and enhancements will continue in the new repository.**\n\n![Console TUI Example](channels-console-tui5.gif)\n\nA lightweight, easy-to-use tool for real-time visibility into your Rust channels and streams. Inspect live message contents and observe how channels interact to better understand data flow. Track queue depth, delay, throughput, and memory usage to spot channel-related issues.\n\nSupports [std::sync](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/index.html), [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), [futures-rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs), and [crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) channels, plus any type implementing the [futures::Stream](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html) trait.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Zero-cost when disabled** — fully gated by a feature flag\n- **Minimal configuration** - just one `channel!` or `stream!` macro to start collecting metrics\n- **Detailed stats** - per channel/stream status, sent/received messages, queue capacity, and memory usage\n- **Background processing** - minimal profiling impact\n- **Live monitoring** - view metrics in a clear, real-time TUI dashboard (built with [ratatui.rs](https://ratatui.rs/))\n\n## Getting started\n\n`Cargo.toml`\n\n```toml\nchannels-console = { version = \"0.3\", optional = true, features=['tokio', 'futures', 'crossbeam'] }\n\n[features]\nchannels-console = [\"dep:channels-console\"]\n```\n\nThis config ensures that the lib has **zero** overhead unless explicitly enabled via a `channels-console` feature.\n\n[std::sync](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/index.html) channels can be instrumented by default. Enable `tokio`, `futures`, or `crossbeam` features for [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), [futures-rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs), and [crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) channels, respectively.\n\n### Instrumenting Channels\n\nUse the `channel!` macro to monitor selected channels:\n\n```rust\nlet (tx1, rx1) = tokio::sync::mpsc::channel::<i32>(10);\n#[cfg(feature = \"channels-console\")]\nlet (tx1, rx1) = channels_console::channel!((tx1, rx1));\n\nlet (mut txb, mut rxb) = futures_channel::mpsc::channel::<i32>(10);\n#[cfg(feature = \"channels-console\")]\nlet (mut txb, mut rxb) = channels_console::channel!((txb, rxb), capacity = 10);\n```\n\nFutures and `std::sync` bounded channels don't provide an API exposing their size, so you have to provide `capacity` to the `channel!` macro.\n\n### Instrumenting Streams\n\nUse the `stream!` macro to monitor any type implementing the `Stream` trait:\n\n```rust\nuse futures::stream::{self, StreamExt};\n\nlet s = stream::iter(1..=10);\n#[cfg(feature = \"channels-console\")]\nlet s = channels_console::stream!(s, label = \"my-stream\");\n\nlet items: Vec<_> = s.collect().await;\n```\n\nThis is the only change you have to do in your codebase. Both macros return exactly the same types so they remain 100% compatible.\n\nNow, install `channels-console` TUI:\n\n```bash\ncargo install channels-console --features=tui\n```\n\nExecute your program with `--features=channels-console`:\n\n```bash\ncargo run --features=channels-console\n```\n\nIn a different terminal run `channels-console` CLI to start the TUI and see live usage metrics:\n\n```bash\nchannels-console\n```\n\n![Console Dashboard](console-dashboard5.png)\n\n### Quickstart demo guide\n\n1. Install CLI:\n\n```bash\ncargo install channels-console --features=tui\n```\n\n2. Clone this repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:pawurb/channels-console.git\n```\n\n3. Run `console_feed` example:\n\n```bash\ncd channels-console\ncargo run --example console_feed_tokio --features=channels-console\n```\n\n4. Run TUI (in a different terminal):\n\n```bash\nchannels-console\n```\n\n## How it works?\n\nThe `channel!` macro wraps channels with lightweight proxies that transparently forward all messages while collecting real-time statistics. Each `send` and `recv` operation passes through a monitored proxy channel that emits updates to a background metrics system.\n\nThe `stream!` macro wraps streams and tracks items as they are yielded, collecting statistics about throughput and completion.\n\nIn the background, an HTTP server process exposes gathered metrics in a JSON format, allowing the TUI process to display them in the interface.\n\n### A note on accuracy\n\n`channels-console` instruments proxy channels that wrap your actual channel instances. It observes messages as they pass through these proxies rather than when they are finally consumed. As a result, the displayed metrics are an approximation of real channel activity - useful for debugging and diagnosing flow issues, but not a 100% accurate sourc",

      "readme": "# Bookokrat\n\nBookokrat is a terminal-based EPUB reader with a split-view library and reader, full MathML and image rendering, automatic bookmarks, and inline annotations.\n\n## Demo\n\n![CleanShot 2025-10-28 at 16 28 21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a45d2e6a-4d2b-4f70-a77f-ed2f7cabc8d8)\n\n\n## What You Can Do\n- Browse every EPUB in the current directory, drill into the table of contents, and resume exactly where you left off.\n- Search inside the current chapter or across the whole book, jump through a per-book history, and inspect reading statistics.\n- Highlight text, attach comments, copy snippets or entire chapters, and toggle the raw HTML source for debugging.\n- Open images in-place, follow internal anchors, launch external links in your browser, and hand off the book to your system viewer.\n\n## Keyboard Reference\n\nBookokrat follows Vim-style keybindings throughout the interface for consistent, efficient navigation.\n\n### Global Commands\n- `q` - Quit application\n- `Tab` - Switch focus between library/TOC and content panels\n- `Esc` - Clear selection/search or dismiss popups\n\n### Navigation (Vim-style)\n- `j/k` - Move down/up (works in all lists and reader)\n- `h/l` - Collapse/expand in TOC; previous/next chapter in reader\n- `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` - Scroll half-page down/up\n- `gg` - Jump to top\n- `G` - Jump to bottom\n- `Ctrl+o` / `Ctrl+i` - Jump backward/forward in history\n\n### Search\n- `/` - Start search (filter in library/TOC; search in reader)\n- `n` / `N` - Jump to next/previous match\n- `Space+f` - Reopen last book-wide search\n- `Space+F` - Start fresh book-wide search\n\n### Library & TOC Panel\n- `Enter` - Open highlighted book or heading\n- `h` / `l` - Collapse/expand entry\n- `H` / `L` - Collapse/expand all\n\n### Reader Panel\n- `h` / `l` - Previous/next chapter\n- `Space+s` - Toggle raw HTML view\n- `Space+c` - Copy entire chapter\n- `Space+z` - Copy debug transcript\n- `c` or `Ctrl+C` - Copy selection\n- `p` - Toggle profiler overlay\n\n### Comments & Annotations\n- `a` - Create or edit comment on selection\n- `d` - Delete comment under cursor\n\n### Popups & External Actions\n- `Space+h` - Toggle reading history popup\n- `Space+d` - Show book statistics popup\n- `Space+o` - Open current book in OS viewer\n- `Enter` - Open image popup (when on image) or activate popup selection\n\n### Popup Navigation\nAll popups (search results, reading history, book stats) support:\n- `j/k` - Move up/down\n- `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` - Half-page scroll\n- `gg` / `G` - Jump to top/bottom\n- `Enter` - Activate selection\n- `Esc` - Close popup\n\n## Mouse Support\n- Scroll with the wheel over either pane; Bookokrat batches rapid wheel events for smooth scrolling.\n- Single-click focuses a pane; double-click in the library opens the selection; double-click in the reader selects a word; triple-click selects the paragraph.\n- Click-and-drag to highlight text; release on a hyperlink to open it; drag past the viewport edges to auto-scroll.\n- Click images to open the zoom popup; click again or press any key to close; clicking history or stats entries activates them immediately.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\nBookokrat requires a C compiler/linker to be installed on your system for building dependencies.\n\n**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install build-essential\n```\n\n**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**\n```bash\nsudo dnf install gcc make\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\n**Windows:**\nInstall [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) with the \"Desktop development with C++\" workload.\n\n### Install Bookokrat\n\n1. Install Rust via https://rustup.rs if needed.\n2. Install bookokrat using Cargo:\n\n```bash\ncargo install bookokrat\n```\n\n3. Place EPUB files alongside the binary (or run within your library directory) and navigate with the shortcuts above.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n**Error: \"linker 'cc' not found\"**\n\nThis means you don't have a C compiler installed. Install the build tools for your platform (see Prerequisites above), then try again.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis project is based on [bookrat](https://github.com/dmitrysobolev/bookrat) by Dmitry Sobolev, licensed under the MIT License.\n",

快速拦截（可被 try-catch 捕获）\n\n```python\nctx = never_jscore.Context()\n\n# 适合简单场景\nencrypted_data = ctx.evaluate(\"\"\"\n    (async () => {\n        const originalSend = XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send;\n        XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function(data) {\n            $return({\n                url: this._url,\n                encrypted: data\n            });\n        };\n\n        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.open('POST', 'https://api.example.com/login');\n        xhr.send(encryptedPayload);\n    })()\n\"\"\")\n\nprint(f\"拦截到的加密数据: {encrypted_data['encrypted']}\")\n```\n\n#### 模式 2: `$terminate()` - 强制终止（**无法被 try-catch 捕获** ⭐ v2.4.3+ 新增）\n\n**关键特性：** 使用 V8 `terminate_execution()`，绕过所有 try-catch 防护！\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nctx = never_jscore.Context()\nctx.clear_hook_data()  # 清空之前的数据（可选，会自动清空）\n\n# Hook XMLHttpRequest.send\nctx.compile(\"\"\"\n    XMLHttpRequest.prototype.send = function(data) {\n        // ⚡ 使用 $terminate 强制终止，无法被 try-catch 捕获\n        $terminate({\n            url: this._url,\n            method: this._method,\n            encrypted: data\n        });\n    };\n\"\"\")\n\n# 执行目标代码（即使有 try-catch 也会被终止）\ntry:\n    ctx.evaluate(\"\"\"\n        try {\n            const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n            xhr.open('POST', 'https://api.example.com/login');\n            xhr.send(encryptedPayload);\n        } catch (e) {\n            // ❌ 这里不会执行 - $terminate 无法被捕获！\n            console.log(\"Will not execute\");\n        }\n    \"\"\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # ✅ Python 端捕获到终止\n    print(f\"JS 被强制终止: {e}\")\n\n# 获取拦截的数据\nhook_data = ctx.get_hook_data()\nif hook_data:\n    data = json.loads(hook_data)\n    print(f\"拦截到的加密数据: {data['encrypted']}\")\n\n# ⚠️ 注意：每次 evaluate()/call() 前会自动清空 hook 数据\n# 如果需要保留上一次的数据，必须在下一次执行前先读取\n```\n\n**两种模式对比：**\n\n| 特性 | `$return()` | `$terminate()` ⭐ |\n|------|-------------|-------------------|\n| 速度 | ✅ 快 | ✅ 快 |\n| try-catch | ⚠️ 可被捕获 | ✅ **无法被捕获** |\n| 适用场景 | 简单 Hook | 对抗加固代码 |\n| 数据获取 | 直接返回值 | `ctx.get_hook_data()` |\n| 多次执行 | ✅ 可复用 Context | ⚠️ 建议清理后复用 |\n\n**Hook API 总览**：\n- **模式 1：** `$return(value)`, `$exit(value)`, `__neverjscore_return__(value)`\n- **模式 2：** `$terminate(value)`, `__saveAndTerminate__(value)` ⭐ 新增\n\n**典型应用场",
