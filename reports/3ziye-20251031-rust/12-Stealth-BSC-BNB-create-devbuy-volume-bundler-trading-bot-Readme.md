## Setup

1. **Install Rust** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. **Create `.env` file** in project root:
   ```env
   # Main wallet for token creation
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_main_wallet_private_key
   IMAGE_PATH=./path/to/your/token/image.png
   
   # For bundle buying (multiple wallets)
   BUNDLE_WALLETS=wallet1_key,wallet2_key,wallet3_key,wallet4_key
   BUNDLE_AMOUNTS=0.001,0.002,0.0015,0.003
   
   # For volume trading
   VOLUME_LOOPS=10
   BUY_AMOUNT=0.01
   SELL_PERCENTAGE=0.95
   TRADING_INTERVAL=30
   ```

3. **Configure token** in `src/config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "YourTokenName",
     "shortName": "SYMBOL",
     "desc": "Token description",
     "symbol": "BNB",
     "preSale": "0.00001"
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Token Creation Only
```bash
cargo run -- --mode create
```

### Bundle Buy (Multi-Wallet)
```bash
cargo run -- --mode bundle --token-address 0x...
```

### Volume Trading (Buy/Sell Loops)
```bash
cargo run -- --mode volume --token-address 0x... --loops 20
```

### Combined Operations
```bash
cargo run -- --mode create-bundle-volume
```

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (.env)
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: Main wallet private key for token creation
- `IMAGE_PATH`: Local path to token image file
- `BUNDLE_WALLETS`: Comma-separated private keys for bundle buying
- `BUNDLE_AMOUNTS`: Comma-separated BNB amounts for each bundle wallet
- `VOLUME_LOOPS`: Number of buy/sell cycles to execute
- `BUY_AMOUNT`: BNB amount for each buy transaction
- `SELL_PERCENTAGE`: Percentage of holdings to sell (0.95 = 95%)
- `TRADING_INTERVAL`: Seconds between trades in volume mode

### Token Configuration (config.json)
- `name`: Full token name
- `shortName`: Token symbol
- `preSale`: Initial buy amount in BNB
- `desc`: Token description
- `launchTime`: Unix timestamp (future date)
- `lpTradingFee`: Liquidity pool trading fee percentage

## Workflow Examples

### 1. Create Token + Bundle Buy
```
1. Create token with main wallet (0.011 BNB required)
2. Wait for token contract deployment
3. Execute bundle buys across multiple wallets
4. Generate initial volume and liquidity
```

### 2. Volume Trading Session
```
1. Start with existing token address
2. Execute 10-20 buy/sell cycles over time
3. Random intervals (30-60 seconds between trades)
4. Maintain 5% holdings at all times
5. Create natural-looking trading patterns
```

### 3. Full Launch Strategy
```
1. Token creation with dev buy
2. Bundle buy across 4-6 wallets (0.002-0.005 BNB each)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for initial setup
4. Begin volume trading loops for 30-60 minutes
5. Monitor and adjust trading parameters
```

## Requirements

### Minimum BNB Balances
- **Main Wallet**: 0.011+ BNB (creation + dev buy)
- **Bundle Wallets**: 0.002-0.01 BNB each (depending on strategy)
- **Volume Trading**: Additional 0.1+ BNB for trading loops

### Additional Requirements
- **Local Image File**: PNG/JPG for token (not URL)
- **Multiple Wallets**: For bundle buying features
- **Stable Internet**: For consistent API and blockchain interaction

## Advanced Features

### Smart Timing
- Random delays between transactions
- Natural trading patterns
- Anti-MEV protection

### Risk Management
- Maximum loss limits per wallet
- Emergency stop conditions
- Transaction failure retry logic

### Monitoring
- Real-time balance tracking
- Transaction success/failure logging
- Volume and price impact analysis

## Troubleshooting

**"insufficient funds"**: Check BNB balance across all configured wallets

**"File not found"**: Set `IMAGE_PATH` to local file path, not URL

**"Bundle buy failed"**: Verify wallet private keys and amounts in environment

**"Volume trading stopped"**: Check wallet balances and token address validity

## Security

⚠️ **Critical Security Notes**:
- Never commit `.env` files with private keys
- Use separate wallets for diff
