<!-- start-intro -->
NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source reference stack that simplifies running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) always-on assistants more safely.
It installs the [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) runtime, part of NVIDIA Agent Toolkit, which provides additional security for running autonomous agents.
It also includes open source models such as [NVIDIA Nemotron](https://build.nvidia.com).

> **Alpha software**
>
> NemoClaw is available in early preview starting March 16, 2026.
> This software is not production-ready.
> Interfaces, APIs, and behavior may change without notice as we iterate on the design.
> The project is shared to gather feedback and enable early experimentation.
> We welcome issues and discussion from the community while the project evolves.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with NemoClaw and your first sandboxed OpenClaw agent.

> **ℹ️ Note**
>
> NemoClaw creates a fresh OpenClaw instance inside the sandbox during onboarding.

### Prerequisites

Check the prerequisites before you start to ensure you have the necessary software and hardware to run NemoClaw.

#### Hardware

| Resource | Minimum        | Recommended      |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU      | 4 vCPU         | 4+ vCPU          |
| RAM      | 8 GB           | 16 GB            |
| Disk     | 20 GB free     | 40 GB free       |

The sandbox image is approximately 2.4 GB compressed. During image push, the Docker daemon, k3s, and the OpenShell gateway run alongside the export pipeline, which buffers decompressed layers in memory. On machines with less than 8 GB of RAM, this combined usage can trigger the OOM killer. If you cannot add memory, configuring at least 8 GB of swap can work around the issue at the cost of slower performance.

#### Software

| Dependency | Version                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Linux      | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later |
| Node.js    | 22.16 or later |
| npm        | 10 or later |
| Container runtime | Supported runtime installed and running |
| [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) | Installed |

#### Container Runtime Support

| Platform | Supported runtimes | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Linux | Docker | Primary supported path today |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Colima, Docker Desktop | Recommended runtimes for supported macOS setups |
| macOS | Podman | Not supported yet. NemoClaw currently depends on OpenShell support for Podman on macOS. |
| Windows WSL | Docker Desktop (WSL backend) | Supported target path |

#### macOS first-run checklist

On a fresh macOS machine, install the prerequisites in this order:

1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Install and start a supported container runtime:
   - Docker Desktop
   - Colima
3. Run the NemoClaw installer.

This avoids the two most common first-run failures on macOS:

- missing developer tools needed by the installer and Node.js toolchain
- Docker connection errors when no supported container runtime is installed or running

> **💡 Tip**
>
> For DGX Spark, follow the [DGX Spark setup guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw/blob/main/spark-install.md). It covers Spark-specific prerequisites, such as cgroup v2 and Docker configuration, before running the standard installer.

### Install NemoClaw and Onboard OpenClaw Agent

Download and run the installer script.
The script installs Node.js if it is not already present, then runs the guided onboard wizard to create a sandbox, configure inference, and apply security policies.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
```

If you use nvm or fnm to manage Node.js, the installer may not update your current shell's PATH.
If `nemoclaw` is not found after install, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for zsh) or open a new terminal.

When the install completes, a summary confirms the running environment:
