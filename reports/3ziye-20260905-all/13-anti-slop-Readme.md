# anti-slop

[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/dmmulroy/anti-slop)](https://skills.sh/dmmulroy/anti-slop)

Opinionated Oxlint rules that reject low-evidence and low-signal TypeScript and JavaScript patterns.

Anti-slop is first and foremost the ruleset I use with my work, projects, and team. It reflects my preferences and taste rather than attempting to be a universal coding standard.

**This project is meant to be vendored**, not treated as a fixed npm dependency. There is no official npm package. Copy the rules into your repository, read them, and change them to match your team's standards. The bundled agent skill handles the initial copy and configuration; after that, the vendored files are yours to maintain and make your own. Community-maintained forks and packages are welcome, but their compatibility and release lifecycle belong to their maintainers.

## Install with an agent skill

```bash
npx skills add dmmulroy/anti-slop --skill install-anti-slop
```

Then ask your coding agent to install or configure anti-slop in the current repository. The skill copies the plugin, installs compatible Oxlint dependencies—matching an existing Oxlint version when present—merges the plugin into the existing lint configuration, enables every generic rule, and validates the result. In repositories that depend directly on Effect, it also enables the opt-in Effect rule group.

To inspect available skills first:

```bash
npx skills add dmmulroy/anti-slop --list
```

## Manual local installation

Copy `src/` into the target repository, for example at `tools/oxlint/anti-slop/`. If the repository already uses `oxlint`, install `@oxlint/plugins` at exactly the resolved Oxlint version. Otherwise, install the same current version of both packages. Keep both versions exact so upgrades move them together.

Register the copied entry point in `oxlint.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "oxlint";

export default defineConfig({
  ignorePatterns: [
    ".agent/**",
    ".agents/**",
    ".claude/**",
    ".codex/**",
    ".continue/**",
    ".cursor/**",
    ".gemini/**",
    ".opencode/**",
    ".pi/**",
    ".roo/**",
    ".windsurf/**",
    "tools/oxlint/anti-slop/**",
  ],
  jsPlugins: [
    { name: "anti-slop", specifier: "./tools/oxlint/anti-slop/index.ts" },
  ],
  rules: {
    "anti-slop/no-chained-type-assertions": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-conditional-empty-object-spread": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-known-value-widening": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-module-mocking": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-object-parameters": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-reflect-apply": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-reflect-get": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-runtime-typeof": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-shape-in-symbol-names": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-parameters": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-returns": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-type-aliases": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unsafe-dictionary-type": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-widen-then-assert": "error",
    "anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion": "error"
  }
});
```

The same `ignorePatterns`, `jsPlugins`, and rules work under `lint` in a Vite+ config. Merge the ignore patterns into Vite+'s `fmt.ignorePatterns` as well so `vp check` does not reformat installed agent assets or the vendored plugin. Preserve existing ignores and add any other project-local agent tooling directories detected in the repository; do not broadly ignore every dot-directory.

### Optional Effect rules

Effect-specific rules live in a separate plugin so projects that do not use Effect do not inherit Effect architecture policy. Register the Effect entry point only in repositories that use Effect:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  jsPlugins: [
    { name: "anti-slop", specifier: "./tools/oxlint/anti-slop/index.ts" },
    {
      name: "anti-slop-effect",
      specifier: "./tools/oxlint/anti-slop/effect/index.ts"
    }
  ],
  rules: {
    "anti-slop-effect/no-service-constructor-imports": "error"
  }
});
```

## Rules

### Generic rules

- `no-chained-type-assertions` — rejects nested `as` and angle-bracket assertions that fabricate evidence; chains made only of `as const` remain valid.
- `no-conditional-empty-object-spread` — reports object spreads that use a conditional `{}` branch to omit fields. It intentionally has no autofix because omission is not equivalent to assigning `undefined`.
- `no-known-value-widening` — rejects known expressions flowing into explicit `unknown`, `object`, anonymous-object, or open-dictionary targets, including known arguments passed to local `unknown` type predicates. Empty dictionary accumulators and finite-key `Record` targets remain valid.
- `no-module-mocking` — rejects Vitest and Jest `mock`, `doMock`, and `unstable_mockModule` calls in favor of real dependency seams.
- `no-object-parameters` — rejects `object`, unions containing it, and scoped or transparent generic aliases that resolve to it on function inputs.
- `no-reflect-apply` — rejects global `Refl
