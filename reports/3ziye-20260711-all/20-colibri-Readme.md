**Tiny engine, immense model.** Run **GLM-5.2 (744B-parameter MoE)** on a consumer machine with ~25 GB of RAM — in pure C, with zero dependencies, by streaming experts from disk.

## The idea

A 744B Mixture-of-Experts model activates only ~40B parameters per token — and only ~11 GB of those change from token to token (the routed experts). So:

- the **dense part** (attention, shared experts, embeddings — ~17B params) stays **resident in RAM at int4** (~9.9 GB);
- the **21,504 routed experts** (75 MoE layers × 256 experts + the MTP head, ~19 MB each at int4) live **on disk** (~370 GB) and are **streamed on demand**, with a per-layer LRU cache, an optional pinned hot-store, and the OS page cache as a free L2.

The engine is a single C file (`c/glm.c`, ~2,400 lines) plus small headers. No BLAS, no Python at runtime, no GPU required (an opt-in CUDA tier for pinned experts exists — see below).

## What's implemented

- **Faithful GLM-5.2 (`glm_moe_dsa`) forward** — validated token-exact against a `transformers` oracle (teacher-forcing 32/32, greedy 20/20 on a tiny-random model with the real architecture).
- **MLA attention** (q/kv-LoRA, interleaved partial RoPE) with **compressed KV-cache**: 576 floats/token instead of 32,768 (57× smaller — GLM-5.2 has 64 heads and no GQA).
- **DeepSeek-V3-style sigmoid router** (noaux_tc, routed_scaling_factor), shared expert, first-3-dense layers.
- **Native MTP speculative decoding** — GLM-5.2's own multi-token-prediction head (layer 78) drafts tokens that the main model verifies in one batched forward. **The head must be int8** (the converter does this by default): at int4 draft acceptance collapses to 0–4% and speculation never engages; at int8 it's 39–59% acceptance, **2.2–2.8 tokens/forward** (community-measured, [#8](https://github.com/JustVugg/colibri/issues/8)). Lossless — *and stays lossless under sampling* via rejection sampling. Honest caveat from the same measurement: on a **cold** cache each verified draft routes to extra experts (~660 → ~1100 expert-loads/token), so speculation can be a net *time* loss until the cache/pin warms up — the adaptive guard and `DRAFT=0` are there for that.
- **True sampling** — temperature + nucleus, defaults tuned for int4 reality (0.7 / 0.90; the official 1.0 / 0.95 samples quantization noise from the tail).
- **Integer-dot kernels** (Q8_0-style int8 activations, AVX2 `maddubs`): int8 matmuls 1.4–2.5× faster (119 GFLOP/s measured), int4 1.8× in batch — routing decided per shape by measurement (int4 single-row stays f32: it measured slower).
- **MLA weight absorption** (DeepSeek trick) for decode: no per-token k/v reconstruction — the query absorbs `kv_b`, context is projected after attention. Validated exact: TF 32/32 and generation 20/20 with absorption forced everywhere.
- **Async expert readahead**: while one block of experts is being multiplied, the kernel is already reading the next (`WILLNEED`).
- **Quantization kernels**: int8 / packed int4 / packed int2, per-row scales, AVX2, dequant-on-use. Packing validated bit-identical to the int8 container.
- **DSA sparse attention** — GLM-5.2's lightning indexer, faithful to the reference `glm_moe_dsa` modeling: per-layer top-2048 causal key selection (full/shared indexer layers), auto-detected from the `out-idx-*` weights (`--indexer` converter mode, ~189 MB extracted from the FP8 repo). Validated exact: forcing the selection to keep every key reproduces dense attention token-for-token. `DSA=0` disables, `DSA_TOPK` overrides.
- **KV-cache persistence** — conversations reopen **warm** across engine restarts: serve mode appends the compressed MLA KV to `.coli_kv` after every turn (~182 KB/token, crash-safe) and resumes it at startup with zero re-prefill. Validated byte-identical to an uninterrupted session. `KVSAVE=0` disables.
- **Router-lookahead prefetch** (`PILOT=1`, experimental) — the next layer's routing is 71.6% predictable from the current layer's post-attention state (measured); a dedicated I/O thread prefetches those experts while the current layer computes.
- **Batch-union MoE**: in prefill (and MTP verification), each unique expert of the batch is read once and applied to every position that routes to it.
- **Byte-level BPE tokenizer in C** (GPT-2-style with Unicode-property regex, 320k merges).
- **RAM safety**: the expert cache is auto-sized from `MemAvailable` at startup — an honest peak projection (working set, KV, MTP row, reconstruction buffers) so the kernel OOM-killer never fires.
- **Offline FP8→int4 converter** (`c/tools/convert_fp8_to_int4.py`): downloads one shard at a time (~5 GB), dequants (128×128 block scales), requantizes to the engine's container, deletes the shard — the 75
