> 🌙 **Let Claude Code do research while you sleep.** Wake up to find your paper scored, weaknesses identified, experiments run, and narrative rewritten — autonomously.
>
> 🪶 **Radically lightweight — zero dependencies, zero lock-in.** The entire system is plain Markdown files. No framework to learn, no database to maintain, no Docker to configure, no daemon to babysit. Every skill is a single `SKILL.md` readable by any LLM — swap Claude Code for [Codex CLI](skills/skills-codex/), [OpenClaw](docs/OPENCLAW_ADAPTATION.md), [Cursor](docs/CURSOR_ADAPTATION.md), [Trae](docs/TRAE_ARIS_RUNBOOK_EN.md), [Antigravity](docs/ANTIGRAVITY_ADAPTATION.md), Windsurf, or your own agent and the workflows still work. Fork it, rewrite it, adapt it to your stack.
>
> *💡 ARIS is a methodology, not a platform. What matters is the research workflow — take it wherever you go. 🌱*

Custom [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skills for autonomous ML research workflows. These skills orchestrate **cross-model collaboration** — Claude Code drives the research while an external LLM (via [Codex MCP](https://github.com/openai/codex)) acts as a critical reviewer. 🔀 **Also supports [alternative model combinations](#-alternative-model-combinations) (Kimi, LongCat, DeepSeek, etc.) — no Claude or OpenAI API required.** For example, [MiniMax-M2.7 + GLM-5 or GLM-5 + MiniMax-M2.7](docs/MiniMax-GLM-Configuration.md). 🤖 **[Codex CLI native](skills/skills-codex/)** — full skill set also available for OpenAI Codex. 🖱️ **[Cursor](docs/CURSOR_ADAPTATION.md)** — works in Cursor too. 🖥️ **[Trae](docs/TRAE_ARIS_RUNBOOK_EN.md)** — ByteDance AI IDE. 🚀 **[Antigravity](docs/ANTIGRAVITY_ADAPTATION.md)** — Google's agent-first IDE. 🆓 **[Free tier via ModelScope](docs/MODELSCOPE_GUIDE.md) — zero cost, zero lock-in.**

> 💭 **Why not self-play with a single model?** Using Claude Code subagents or agent teams for both execution and review is technically possible, but tends to fall into **local minima** — the same model reviewing its own patterns creates blind spots.
>
> *Think of it like adversarial vs. stochastic bandits: a single model self-reviewing is the stochastic case (predictable reward noise), while cross-model review is adversarial (the reviewer actively probes weaknesses the executor didn't anticipate) — and adversarial bandits are fundamentally harder to game.*
>
> 💭 **Why two models, not more?** Two is the minimum needed to break self-play blind spots, and 2-player games converge to Nash equilibrium far more efficiently than n-player ones. Adding more reviewers increases API cost and coordination overhead with diminishing returns — the biggest gain is going from 1→2, not 2→4.
>
> Claude Code's strength is fast, fluid execution; Codex (GPT-5.4 xhigh) is slower but more deliberate and rigorous in critique. These complementary styles — **speed × rigor** — produce better outcomes than either model talking to itself.
