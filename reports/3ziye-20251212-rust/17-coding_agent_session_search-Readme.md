## 💡 Why This Exists

### The Problem

AI coding agents are transforming how we write software. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, Pi-Agent; each creates a trail of conversations, debugging sessions, and problem-solving attempts. But this wealth of knowledge is **scattered and unsearchable**:

- **Fragmented storage**: Each agent stores data differently—JSONL files, SQLite databases, markdown logs, proprietary JSON formats
- **No cross-agent visibility**: Solutions discovered in Cursor are invisible when you're using Claude Code
- **Lost context**: That brilliant debugging session from two weeks ago? Good luck finding it by scrolling through files
- **No semantic search**: File-based grep doesn't understand code structure or natural language queries

### The Solution

`cass` treats your coding agent history as a **unified knowledge base**. It:

1. **Normalizes** disparate formats into a common schema
2. **Indexes** everything with a purpose-built full-text search engine
3. **Surfaces** relevant past conversations in milliseconds
4. **Respects** your privacy—everything stays local, nothing phones home

### Who Benefits

- **Individual developers**: Find that solution you know you've seen before
- **Teams**: Share institutional knowledge across different tool preferences
- **AI agents themselves**: Let your current agent learn from all your past agents (via robot mode)
- **Power users**: Build workflows that leverage your complete coding history

## ✨ Key Features

### ⚡ Instant Search (Sub-60ms Latency)
- **"Search-as-you-type"**: Results update instantly with every keystroke.
- **Edge N-Gram Indexing**: We frontload the work by pre-computing prefix matches (e.g., "cal" -> "calculate") during indexing, trading disk space for O(1) lookup speed at query time.
- **Smart Tokenization**: Handles `snake_case` ("my_var" matches "my" and "var"), hyphenated terms, and code symbols (`c++`, `foo.bar`) correctly.
- **Zero-Stall Updates**: The background indexer commits changes atomically; `reader.reload()` ensures new messages appear in the search bar immediately without restarting.

### 🎯 Advanced Search Features
- **Wildcard Patterns**: Full glob-style pattern support:
  - `foo*` - Prefix match (finds "foobar", "foo123")
  - `*foo` - Suffix match (finds "barfoo", "configfoo")
  - `*foo*` - Substring match (finds "afoob", "configuration")
- **Auto-Fuzzy Fallback**: When exact searches return sparse results, automatically retries with `*term*` wildcards to broaden matches. Visual indicator shows when fallback is active.
- **Query History Deduplication**: Recent searches deduplicated to show unique queries; navigate with `Up`/`Down` arrows.
- **Match Quality Ranking**: New ranking mode (cycle with `F12`) that prioritizes exact matches over wildcard/fuzzy results.
- **Match Highlighting**: Use `--highlight` in robot mode to wrap matching terms with markers (`**bold**` for text, `<mark>` for HTML output).

### 🖥️ Rich Terminal UI (TUI)
- **Three-Pane Layout**: Filter bar (top), scrollable results (left), and syntax-highlighted details (right).
- **Multi-Line Result Display**: Each result shows location and up to 3 lines of context; alt
