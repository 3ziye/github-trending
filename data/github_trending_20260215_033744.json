In addition, the models feature strong contextual understanding, enabling adaptive control of tone, speaking rate, and emotional expression based on instructions and text semantics, and they show markedly improved robustness to noisy input text. Key features:\n\n* **Powerful Speech Representation**: Powered by the self-developed Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz, it achieves efficient acoustic compression and high-dimensional semantic modeling of speech signals. It fully preserves paralinguistic information and acoustic environmental features, enabling high-speed, high-fidelity speech reconstruction through a lightweight non-DiT architecture.\n* **Universal End-to-End Architecture**: Utilizing a discrete multi-codebook LM architecture, it realizes full-information end-to-end speech modeling. This completely bypasses the information bottlenecks and cascading errors inherent in traditional LM+DiT schemes, significantly enhancing the model’s versatility, generation efficiency, and performance ceiling.\n* **Extreme Low-Latency Streaming Generation**: Based on the innovative Dual-Track hybrid streaming generation architecture, a single model supports both streaming and non-streaming generation. It can output the first audio packet immediately after a single character is input, with end-to-end synthesis latency as low as 97ms, meeting the rigorous demands of real-time interactive scenarios.\n* **Intelligent Text Understanding and Voice Control**: Supports speech generation driven by natural language instructions, allowing for flexible control over multi-dimensional acoustic attributes such as timbre, emotion, and prosody. By deeply integrating text semantic understanding, the model adaptively adjusts tone, rhythm, and emotional expression, achieving lifelike “what you imagine is what you hear” output.\n\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-TTS-Repo/overview.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n<p>\n\n### Released Models Description and Download\n\nBelow is an introduction and download information for the Qwen3-TTS models that have already been released. Other models mentioned in the technical report will be released in the near future. Please se",

Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).\n\n## Why Plugins\n\nCowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.\n\nEach plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific job function. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your company — your tools, your terminology, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.\n\n## Plugin Marketplace\n\nWe're open-sourcing 11 plugins built and inspired by our own work:\n\n| Plugin | How it helps | Connectors |\n|--------|-------------|------------|\n| **[productivity](./productivity)** | Manage tasks, calendars, daily workflows, and personal context so you spend less time repeating yourself. | Slack, Notion, Asana, Linear, Jira, Monday, ClickUp, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[sales](./sales)** | Research prospects, prep for calls, review your pipeline, draft outreach, and build competitive battlecards. | Slack, HubSpot, Close, Clay, ZoomInfo, Notion, Jira, Fireflies, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[customer-support](./customer-support)** | Triage tickets, draft responses, package escalations, research customer context, and turn resolved issues into knowledge base articles. | Slack, Intercom, HubSpot, Guru, Jira, Notion, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[product-management](./product-management)** | Write specs, plan roadmaps, synthesize user research, keep stakeholders updated, and track the competitive landscape. | Slack, Linear, Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Jira, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Pendo, Intercom, Fireflies |\n| **[marketing](./marketing)** | Draft content, plan campaigns, enforce brand voice, brief on competitors, and report on performance across channels. | Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, Klaviyo |\n| **[legal](./legal)** | Review contracts, triage NDAs, navigate compliance, assess risk, prep for meetings, and draft templated responses. | Slack, Box, Egnyte, Jira, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[finance](./finance)** | Prep journal entries, reconcile accounts, generate financial statements, analyze variances, manage close, and support audits. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Slack, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[data](./data)** | Query, visualize, and interpret datasets — write SQL, run statistical analysis, build dashboards, and validate your work before sharing. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Hex, Amplitude, Jira |\n| **[enterprise-search](./enterprise-search)** | Find anything across email, chat, docs, and wikis — one query across all your company's tools. | Slack, Notion, Guru, Jira, Asana, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[bio-research](./bio-research)** | Connect to preclinical research tools and databases (literature search, genomics analysis, target prioritization) to accelerate early-stage life sciences R&D. | PubMed, BioRender, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, ChEMBL, Synapse, Wiley, Owkin, Open Targets, Benchling |\n| **[cowork-plugin-management](./cowork-plugin-management)** | Create new plugins or customize existing ones for your organization's specific tools and workflows. | — |\n\nInstall these directly from Cowork, browse the full collection here on GitHub, or build your own.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Cowork\n\nInstall plugins from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace first\nclaude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins\n\n# Then install a specific plugin\nclaude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins\n```\n\nOnce installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (e.g., `/sales:call-prep`, `/data:write-query`).\n\n## How Plugins Work\n\nEvery plugin follows the same structure:\n\n```\nplugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest\n├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections\n├── commands/                    # Slash commands you invoke explicitly\n└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically\n```\n\n- **Skills** encode the domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows Claude needs to give you useful help. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant.\n- **Commands** are explicit actions you trigger (e.g., `/finance:reconciliation`, `/product-management:write-spec`).\n- **Connectors** wire Claude to the external tools your role depends on — CRMs, project trackers, data warehouses, design tools, and more — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).\n\nEvery component is file-based — markdown and ",

      "readme": "# Anthropic's Original Performance Take-Home\n\nThis repo contains a version of Anthropic's original performance take-home, before Claude Opus 4.5 started doing better than humans given only 2 hours.\n\nThe original take-home was a 4-hour one that starts close to the contents of this repo, after Claude Opus 4 beat most humans at that, it was updated to a 2-hour one which started with code which achieved 18532 cycles (7.97x faster than this repo starts you). This repo is based on the newer take-home which has a few more instructions and comes with better debugging tools, but has the starter code reverted to the slowest baseline. After Claude Opus 4.5 we started using a different base for our time-limited take-homes.\n\nNow you can try to beat Claude Opus 4.5 given unlimited time!\n\n## Performance benchmarks \n\nMeasured in clock cycles from the simulated machine. All of these numbers are for models doing the 2 hour version which started at 18532 cycles:\n\n- **2164 cycles**: Claude Opus 4 after many hours in the test-time compute harness\n- **1790 cycles**: Claude Opus 4.5 in a casual Claude Code session, approximately matching the best human performance in 2 hours\n- **1579 cycles**: Claude Opus 4.5 after 2 hours in our test-time compute harness\n- **1548 cycles**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 after many more than 2 hours of test-time compute\n- **1487 cycles**: Claude Opus 4.5 after 11.5 hours in the harness\n- **1363 cycles**: Claude Opus 4.5 in an improved test time compute harness\n- **??? cycles**: Best human performance ever is substantially better than the above, but we won't say how much.\n\nWhile it's no longer a good time-limited test, you can still use this test to get us excited about hiring you! If you optimize below 1487 cycles, beating Claude Opus 4.5's best performance at launch, email us at performance-recruiting@anthropic.com with your code (and ideally a resume) so we can be appropriately impressed, especially if you get near the best solution we've seen. New model releases may change what threshold impresses us though, and no guarantees that we keep this readme updated with the latest on that.\n\nRun `python tests/submission_tests.py` to see which thresholds you pass.\n\n## Warning: LLMs can cheat\n\nNone of the solutions we received on the first day post-release below 1300 cycles were valid solutions. In each case, a language model modified the tests to make the problem easier.\n\nIf you use an AI agent, we recommend instructing it not to change the `tests/` folder and to use `tests/submission_tests.py` for verification.\n\nPlease run the following commands to validate your submission, and mention that you did so when submitting:\n```\n# This should be empty, the tests folder must be unchanged\ngit diff origin/main tests/\n# You should pass some of these tests and use the cycle count this prints\npython tests/submission_tests.py\n```\n\nAn example of this kind of hack is a model noticing that `problem.py` has multicore support, implementing multicore as an optimization, noticing there's no speedup and \"debugging\" that `N_CORES = 1` and \"fixing\" the core count so they get a speedup. Multicore is disabled intentionally in this version.\n",

      "readme": "# /last30days v2\n\n**The AI world reinvents itself every month. This Claude Code skill keeps you current.** /last30days researches your topic across Reddit, X, and the web from the last 30 days, finds what the community is actually upvoting and sharing, and writes you a prompt that works today, not six months ago. Whether it's Ralph Wiggum loops, Suno music prompts, or the latest Midjourney techniques, you'll prompt like someone who's been paying attention.\n\n**New in V2:** Dramatically better search results. Smarter query construction finds posts that V1 missed entirely, and a new two-phase search automatically discovers key @handles and subreddits from initial results, then drills deeper. Also: free X search via [Bird CLI](https://github.com/steipete/bird) (no xAI key needed), `--days=N` for flexible lookback, and automatic model fallback. [Full changelog below.](#whats-new-in-v2)\n\n**The tradeoff:** V2 finds way more content but takes longer — typically 2-8 minutes depending on how niche your topic is. The old V1 was faster but regularly missed results (like returning 0 X posts on trending topics). We think the depth is worth the wait, but if you'd use a faster \"quick mode\" that trades some depth for speed, let us know: [@mvanhorn](https://x.com/mvanhorn) / [@slashlast30days](https://x.com/slashlast30days).\n\n**Best for prompt research**: discover what prompting techniques actually work for any tool (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude, Figma AI, etc.) by learning from real community discussions and best practices.\n\n**But also great for anything trending**: music, culture, news, product recommendations, viral trends, or any question where \"what are people saying right now?\" matters.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/last30days\n\n# Add your API keys\nmkdir -p ~/.config/last30days\ncat > ~/.config/last30days/.env << 'EOF'\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\nXAI_API_KEY=xai-...       # optional if using Bird CLI\nEOF\nchmod 600 ~/.config/last30days/.env\n```\n\n### Optional: Bird CLI for free X search\n\n[Bird CLI](https://github.com/steipete/bird) lets you search X without an xAI API key. If installed and authenticated, /last30days uses it automatically.\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @steipete/bird\nbird login\n```\n\nBird is free and doesn't require an xAI key. If both Bird and an xAI key are available, Bird is preferred.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/last30days [topic]\n/last30days [topic] for [tool]\n```\n\nExamples:\n- `/last30days prompting techniques for ChatGPT for legal questions`\n- `/last30days iOS app mockups for Nano Banana Pro`\n- `/last30days What are the best rap songs lately`\n- `/last30days remotion animations for Claude Code`\n\n## What It Does\n\n1. **Researches** - Scans Reddit and X for discussions from the last 30 days\n2. **Synthesizes** - Identifies patterns, best practices, and what actually works\n3. **Delivers** - Either writes copy-paste-ready prompts for your target tool, or gives you a curated expert-level answer\n\n### Use it for:\n- **Prompt research** - \"What prompting techniques work for legal questions in ChatGPT?\"\n- **Tool best practices** - \"How are people using Remotion with Claude Code?\"\n- **Trend discovery** - \"What are the best rap songs right now?\"\n- **Product research** - \"What do people think of the new M4 MacBook?\"\n- **Viral content** - \"What's the dog-as-human trend on ChatGPT?\"\n\n---\n\n## Example: Nano Banana Pro Prompting (Image Generation)\n\n**Query:** `/last30days nano banana pro prompting`\n\n**Research Output:**\n> JSON prompting is the dominant technique — The X community overwhelmingly uses structured JSON prompts rather than plain text. Creators like @Xmira_belle, @Cicily_aura, @RubenSalvo_, and @mahivisuals all share prompts in JSON format with nested objects for metadata, subject descriptions, lighting, camera specs, and scene composition. @realdigitaldao made a static ad \"in less than 5 min\" using a simple JSON prompt.\n>\n> Prompt adherence is Nano Banana Pro's killer advantage — JSON prompts hit 92% precision for color accuracy, lighting ratios, and composition vs ~68% for natural language prompts, per fofr.ai. @artingent directly compared it to GPT Image 1.5 and noted Nano Banana Pro has higher prompt adherence — \"GPT image 1.5 ignored the Top Down instruction.\"\n>\n> Stop writing \"tag soup\" — act like a Creative Director — The biggest shift is away from comma-separated keyword lists toward natural language descriptions with clear structure. The ICS Framework (Image type, Content, Style) and the 5-element formula (subject, composition, action, setting, style) are the two dominant approaches, per r/nanobanana2pro.\n\n**Key patterns discovered:**\n1. JSON > plain text — Structure prompts as JSON objects with keys for subject, composition, lighting, camera, style — per @Xmira_belle, @Cicily_aura\n2. The 5-element formula — Subject + Composition + Action + Setting + Style — per r/nanobanana2pro\n3. Separate subjects into distinct objects — Multi-character s",

      "readme": "# Quip Network Experimental Node\n\n> **WARNING: This is experimental demonstration software provided without warranty of any kind. It is not intended for production use. Use at your own risk.**\n\nThis project implements a quantum blockchain using quantum annealing for proof-of-work consensus. It features competitive mining between quantum computers (QPU) and classical simulated annealing (SA) with a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe blockchain demonstrates:\n\n- **Quantum Annealing PoW**: Using Ising model optimization as the mining puzzle\n- **Competitive Mining**: Multiple miners (QPU and SA) compete to mine blocks\n- **Multi-Miner Support**: Configure any number of QPU and SA miners\n- **Dynamic Difficulty**: Inverted difficulty mechanism that prevents miner monopolization\n- **Streak Rewards**: Consecutive wins increase block rewards\n- **Solution Diversity**: Requires multiple diverse solutions to prevent trivial mining\n- **Individual Miner Tracking**: Each miner has unique ID and performance stats\n\n## Current Scope\n\nThe current implementation:\n- **Quantum PoW only** - No transactions, accounts, or other typical blockchain features\n- **Demonstration signatures** - The signature system is not yet production-secure; it demonstrates the hybrid ECDSA + WOTS+ approach but requires proper integration\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe plan to build a complete blockchain by forking an existing battle tested codebase to maximize development velocity.\n\n### Phase 1: Core Integration\n- Fork a battle-tested blockchain codebase\n- Integrate our quantum proof-of-work mechanism (Ising model optimization, difficulty adjustment, block time targets already defined)\n- Target: Testnet deployment\n\n### Phase 2: Signature System\n- Integrate our hybrid signature system: classical ECDSA combined with post-quantum WOTS+ signatures\n- Implement stateful signature management\n- Wire signatures into transaction processing and consensus\n\n### Phase 3: Subnet Architecture\n- Implement a subnet system with **objective, measurable metrics** for validation\n- Subnets will solve computational problems (scientific computing, cryptographic proofs, etc.) with verifiable results\n- Define subnet registration, validation mechanisms, and reward distribution\n\n### Phase 4: Smart Contracts\n- Add smart contract support via EVM compatibility (Solidity/Vyper) and/or Rust-based WebAssembly runtime\n- Later: Enable contracts to interact with subnet computational results\n\n### Open Technical Decisions\n1. Which blockchain codebase to fork?\n2. How to structure subnets for different computational problem types?\n3. How to validate objective metrics across the decentralized network?\n4. Performance targets (TPS, finality time, subnet throughput)?\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can run your own node using the \"latest\" release, see the README in the `docker` directory for instructions on how to run the node in a container.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10+):\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv .quip\n   source .quip/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n2. Install the package in editable mode:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -U pip setuptools wheel\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n   This will install all dependencies from pyproject.toml and register console scripts.\n\n3. Set up D-Wave API credentials (optional, for QPU access):\n   ```bash\n   echo \"DWAVE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\" > .env\n   ```\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nquip-protocol/\n├── quip_cli.py                # Main CLI entry point\n├── blockchain_base.py         # Base classes for miners\n├── shared/                    # Core modules\n│   ├── network_node.py       # P2P networking (QUIC protocol)\n│   ├── node.py               # Node state management\n│   ├── block.py              # Block and header dataclasses\n│   ├── block_signer.py       # ECDSA + WOTS+ signatures\n│   ├── quantum_proof_of_work.py  # Ising model PoW\n│   ├── base_miner.py         # Abstract miner interface\n│   └── ...                   # Additional utilities\n├── CPU/                       # CPU-based miners\n│   ├── sa_miner.py           # Simulated annealing miner\n│   └── sa_sampler.py         # SA sampler implementation\n├── GPU/                       # GPU-accelerated miners\n│   ├── cuda_miner.py         # CUDA GPU miner\n│   ├── metal_miner.py        # Apple Metal/MPS miner\n│   └── modal_miner.py        # Modal Labs cloud GPU\n├── QPU/                       # Quantum processor miners\n│   ├── dwave_miner.py        # D-Wave QPU miner\n│   └── dwave_sampler.py      # D-Wave sampler wrapper\n├── docker/                    # Docker deployment files\n├── tests/                     # Test suite\n├── reference/                 # Reference implementation\n└── benchmarks/                # Performance benchmarks\n```\n\n## quip-network-node\n\nRun a single P2P node of a specific type.

Write once, apply forever |\n| **Auto-updated Spec Library** | Best practices live in auto-updated spec files. The more you use it, the better it gets |\n| **Parallel Sessions** | Run multiple agents in tandem - each in its own worktree |\n| **Team Sync** | Share specs across your team. One person's best practice benefits everyone |\n| **Session Persistence** | Work traces persist in your repo. AI remembers project context across sessions |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install globally\nnpm install -g @mindfoldhq/trellis@latest\n\n# 2. Initialize in your project directory\ntrellis init -u your-name\n\n# Or include iFlow CLI support\ntrellis init --iflow -u your-name\n\n# Or include Codex skills support\ntrellis init --codex -u your-name\n\n# 3. Start Claude Code and begin working\n```\n\n> `your-name` becomes your identifier and creates a personal workspace at `.trellis/workspace/your-name/`\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/info.png\" alt=\"Trellis Initialization Example\" />\n</p>\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Educating Your AI\n\nWrite your specs in Markdown. Trellis injects them into every AI session — no more repeating yourself.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase1.png\" alt=\"Teaching AI - Teach Once, Apply Forever\" />\n</p>\n\nDefine your component guidelines, file structure rules, and patterns once. AI automatically applies them when creating new code — using TypeScript with Props interface, following PascalCase naming, building functional components with hooks.\n\n### Ship in Parallel\n\nSpawn multiple Claude sessions in isolated worktrees with `/trellis:parallel`. Work on several features at once, merge when ready.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase2.png\" alt=\"Parallel Work - Multiple features developing simultaneously\" />\n</p>\n\nWhile coding, each worker runs in its own worktree (physically isolated directory), no blocking, no interference. Review and merge completed features while others are still in progress.\n\n### Custom Workflows\n\nDefine custom skills & commands that prepare Claude for specific tasks and contexts.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase3.png\" alt=\"Workflows - Custom commands for instant context loading\" />\n</p>\n\nCreate commands like `/trellis:before-frontend-dev` that load component guidelines, check recent changes, pull in test patterns, and review shared hooks—all with a single slash.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\n.trellis/\n├── workflow.md              # Workflow guide (auto-injected on start)\n├── worktree.yaml            # Multi-agent config (for /trellis:parallel)\n├── spec/                    # Spec library\n│   ├── frontend/            #   Frontend specs\n│   ├── backend/             #   Backend specs\n│   └── guides/              #   Decision & analysis frameworks\n├── workspace/{name}/        # Personal journal\n├── tasks/                   # Task management (progress tracking & more)\n└── scripts/                 # Utilities\n\n.claude/\n├── settings.json            # Hook configuration\n├── agents/                  # Agent definitions\n│   ├── dispatch.md          #   Dispatch Agent (pure routing, doesn't read specs)\n│   ├── implement.md         #   Implement Agent\n│   ├── check.md             #   Check Agent\n│   └── research.md          #   Research Agent\n├── commands/                # Slash commands\n└── hooks/                   # Hook scripts\n ",

Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and login\n2. Add OS → Local → `http://localhost:8000`\n3. Click \"Connect\"\n\n**Try it** (sample F1 dataset):\n\n- Who won the most F1 World Championships?\n- How many races has Lewis Hamilton won?\n- Compare Ferrari vs Mercedes points 2015-2020\n\n## Why Text-to-SQL Breaks in Practice\n\nOur goal is simple: ask a question in english, get a correct, meaningful answer. But raw LLMs writing SQL hit a wall fast:\n\n- **Schemas lack meaning.**\n- **Types are misleading.**\n- **Tribal knowledge is missing.**\n- **No way to learn from mistakes.**\n- **Results generally lack interpretation.**\n\nThe root cause is missing context and missing memory.\n\nDash solves this with **6 layers of grounded context**, a **self-learning loop** that improves with every query, and a focus on **understanding your question** to deliver insights you can act on.\n\n## The Six Layers of Context\n\n| Layer | Purpose | Source |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| **Table Usage** | Schema, columns, relationships | `knowledge/tables/*.json` |\n| **Human Annotations** | Metrics, definitions, and business rules | `knowledge/business/*.json` |\n| **Query Patterns** | SQL that is known to work | `knowledge/queries/*.sql` |\n| **Institutional Knowledge** | Docs, wikis, external references | MCP (optional) |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and discovered fixes | Agno `Learning Machine` |\n| **Runtime Context** | Live schema changes | `introspect_schema` tool |\n\nThe agent retrieves relevant context at query time via hybrid search, then generates SQL grounded in patterns that already work.\n\n## The Self-Learning Loop\n\nDash improves without retraining or fine-tuning. We call this gpu-poor continuous learning.\n\nIt learns through two complementary systems:\n\n| System | Stores | How It Evolves |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **Knowledge** | Validated queries and business context | Curated by you + dash |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and fixes | Managed by `Learning Machine` automatically |\n\n```\nUser Question\n     ↓\nRetrieve Knowledge + Learnings\n     ↓\nReason about intent\n     ↓\nGenerate grounded SQL\n     ↓\nExecute and interpret\n     ↓\n ┌────┴────┐\n ↓         ↓\nSuccess    Error\n ↓         ↓\n ↓         Diagnose → Fix → Save Learning\n ↓                           (never repeated)\n ↓\nReturn insight\n ↓\nOptionally save as Knowledge\n```\n\n**Knowledge** is curated—validated queries and business context you want the agent to build on.\n\n**Learnings** is discovered—patterns the agent finds through trial and error. When a query fails because `position` is TEXT not INTEGER, the agent saves that gotcha. Next time, it knows.\n\n## Insights, Not Just Rows\n\nDash reasons about what makes an answer useful, not just technically correct.\n\n**Question:**\nWho won the most races in 2019?\n\n| Typical SQL Agent | Dash |\n|------------------|------|\n| `Hamilton: 11` | Lewis Hamilton dominated 2019 with **11 wins out of 21 races**, more than double Bottas’s 4 wins. This performance secured his sixth world championship. |\n\n## Deploy to Railway\n\n```sh\nrailway login\n\n./scripts/railway_up.sh\n```\n\n### Production Operations\n\n**Load data and knowledge:**\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_data\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_knowledge\n```\n\n**View logs:**\n\n```sh\nrailway logs --service dash\n```\n\n**Run commands in production:**\n\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash  # CLI mode\n```\n\n**Redeploy after changes:**\n\n```sh\nrailway up --service dash -d\n```\n\n**Open dashboard:**\n```sh\nrailway open\n```\n\n## Adding Knowledge\n\nDash works best when it understands how your organization talks about data.\n\n```\nknowledge/\n├── tables/      # Table meaning and caveats\n├── queries/     # Proven SQL patterns\n└── business/    # Metrics and language\n```\n\n### Table Metadata\n\n```\n{\n  \"table_name\": \"orders\",\n  \"table_description\": \"Customer orders with denormalized line items\",\n  \"use_cases\": [\"Revenue reporting\", \"Customer analytics\"],\n  \"data_quality_notes\": [\n    \"created_at is UTC\",\n    \"status values: pending, completed, refunded\",\n    \"amount stored in cents\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Query Patterns\n\n```\n-- <query name>monthly_revenue</query name>\n-- <query description>\n-- Monthly revenue calculation.\n-- Converts cents to dollars.\n-- Excludes ",

It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves a score of 94.62 on OmniDocBench V1.5, ranking #1 overall, and delivers state-of-the-art results across major document understanding benchmarks, including formula recognition, table recognition, and information extraction.\n\n- **Optimized for Real-World Scenarios**: Designed and optimized for practical business use cases, maintaining robust performance on complex tables, code-heavy documents, seals, and other challenging real-world layouts.\n\n- **Efficient Inference**: With only 0.9B parameters, GLM-OCR supports deployment via vLLM, SGLang, and Ollama, significantly reducing inference latency and compute cost, making it ideal for high-concurrency services and edge deployments.\n\n- **Easy to Use**: Fully open-sourced and equipped with a comprehensive [SDK](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-OCR) and inference toolchain, offering simple installation, one-line invocation, and smooth integration into existing production pipelines.\n\n### News & Updates\n\n- **[Coming Soon]** GLM-OCR Technical Report\n- **[2026.2.12]** Fine-tuning tutorial based on LLaMA-Factory is now available. See: [GLM-OCR Fine-tuning Guide](examples/finetune/README.md)\n\n### Download Model\n\n| Model   | Download Links                                                                                                              | Precision |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| GLM-OCR | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-OCR)<br> [🤖 ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/ZhipuAI/GLM-OCR) | BF16      |\n\n## GLM-OCR SDK\n\nWe provide an SDK for using GLM-OCR more efficiently and conveniently.\n\n### Install SDK\n\n> [UV Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n```bash\n# Install from source\ngit clone https://github.com/zai-org/glm-ocr.git\ncd glm-ocr\nuv venv --python 3.12 --seed && source .venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### Model Deployment\n\nTwo ways to use GLM-OCR:\n\n#### Option 1: Zhipu MaaS API (Recommended for Quick Start)\n\nUse the hosted cloud API – no GPU needed. The cloud service runs the complete GLM-OCR pipeline internally, so the SDK simply forwards your request and returns the result.\n\n1. Get an API key from https://open.bigmodel.cn\n2. Configure `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\npipeline:\n  maas:\n    enabled: true # Enable MaaS mode\n    api_key: your-api-key # Required\n```\n\nThat's it! When `maas.enabled=true`, the SDK acts as a thin wrapper that:\n\n- Forwards your documents to the Zhipu cloud API\n- Returns the results directly (Markdown + JSON layout details)\n- No local processing, no GPU required\n\nInput note (MaaS): the upstream API accepts `file` as a URL or a `data:<mime>;base64,...` data URI.\nIf you have raw base64 without the `data:` prefix, wrap it as a data URI (recommended). The SDK will\nauto-wrap local file paths / bytes / raw base64 into a data URI when calling MaaS.\n\nAPI documentation: https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/guide/models/vlm/glm-ocr\n\n#### Option 2: Self-host with vLLM / SGLang\n\nDeploy the GLM-OCR model locally for full control. The SDK provides the complete pipeline: layout detection, parallel region OCR, and result formatting.\n\n##### Using vLLM\n\nInstall vLLM:\n\n```bash\nuv pip install -U vllm --torch-backend=auto --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly\n# Or use Docker\ndocker pull vllm/vllm-openai:nightly\n```\n\nLaunch the service:\n\n```bash\n# In docker container, uv may not be need for transformers install\nuv pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n\n# Run with MTP for better performance\nvllm serve zai-org/GLM-OCR --allowed-local-media-path / --port 8080 --speculative-config '{\"method\": \"mtp\", \"num_speculative_tokens\": 1}' --served-model-name glm-ocr\n```\n\n##### Using SGLang\n\nIn",

Both leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding capability of their foundation model, Qwen3-Omni. Experiments show that the 1.7B version achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary commercial APIs. Here are the main features:\n\n* **All-in-one**: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B support language identification and speech recognition for 30 languages and 22 Chinese dialects, so as to English accents from multiple countries and regions.\n\n* **Excellent and Fast**: The Qwen3-ASR family ASR models maintains high-quality and robust recognition under complex acoustic environments and challenging text patterns. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves strong performance on both open-sourced and internal benchmarks. While the 0.6B version achieves accuracy-efficient trade-off, it reaches 2000 times throughput at a concurrency of 128. They both achieve streaming / offline unified inference with single model and support transcribe long audio.\n\n* **Novel and strong forced alignment Solution**: We introduce Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B, which supports timestamp prediction for arbitrary units within up to 5 minutes of speech in 11 languages. Evaluations show its timestamp accuracy surpasses E2E based forced-alignment models.\n\n* **Comprehensive inference toolkit**: In addition to open-sourcing the architectures and weights of the Qwen3-ASR series, we also release a powerful, full-featured inference framework that supports vLLM-based batch inference, asynchronous serving, streaming inference, timestamp prediction, and more.\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-ASR-Repo/overview.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p>\n\n\n### Released Models Description and Download\n\nBelow is an introduction and download information for the Qwen3-ASR models.

All elements can be individually dragged, styled, and modified.\n\n#### Scenario 1: Figures to Drawio(xml, svg, pptx)\n\n| Example No. | Original Static Diagram (Input · Non-editable) | DrawIO Reconstruction Result (Output · Fully Editable) |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Example 1: Basic Flowchart | <img src=\"/static/demo/original_1.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Original Diagram 1\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> | <img src=\"/static/demo/recon_1.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Reconstruction Result 1\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> |\n| Example 2: Multi-level Architecture Diagram | <img src=\"/static/demo/original_2.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Original Diagram 2\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> | <img src=\"/static/demo/recon_2.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Reconstruction Result 2\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> |\n| Example 3: Technical Schematic | <img src=\"/static/demo/original_3.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Original Diagram 3\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> | <img src=\"/static/demo/recon_3.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Reconstruction Result 3\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> |\n| Example 4: Scientific Formula Diagram | <img src=\"/static/demo/original_4.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Original Diagram 4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> | <img src=\"/static/demo/recon_4.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Reconstruction Result 4\" style=\"border: 1px solid #eee; border-radius: 4px;\"/> |\n\n#### Scenario 2: PDF to PPTX\n\n\n#### Scenario 3: Human in the Loop Modification\n\n> ✨ Conversion Highlights:\n> 1.  Preserves the layout logic, color matching, and element hierarchy of the original diagram\n> 2.  1:1 restoration of shape stroke/fill and arrow styles (dashed lines/thickness)\n> 3.  Accurate text recognition, supporting direct subsequent editing and format adjustment\n> 4.  All elements are independently selectable, supporting native DrawIO template replacement and layout optimization\n\n## Key Features\n\n*   **Advanced Segmentation**: Using our fine-tuned **SAM 3 (Segment Anything Model 3)** for segmentation of diagram elements.\n*   **Fixed Multi-Round VLM Scanning**: An extraction process guided by **Multimodal LLMs (Qwen-VL/GPT-4V)**.\n*   **High-Quality OCR**:\n    *   **Azure Document Intelligence** for precise text localization.\n    *   **Fallback Mechanism**: Automatically switches to VLM-based end-to-end OCR if Azure services are unreachable.\n    *   **Mistral Vision/MLLM** for correcting text and converting mathematical formulas to **LaTeX** ($\\int f(x) dx$).\n    *   **Crop-Guided Strategy**: Extr",

I'm feeling really great if you ask me honestly!\"\n\n## change this to your reference file path, can be wav/mp3\nprompt_audio = 'audio_file.wav'\n\n## encode audio(takes 10s to init because of librosa first time)\nencoded_prompt = lux_tts.encode_prompt(prompt_audio, rms=0.01)\n\n## generate speech\nfinal_wav = lux_tts.generate_speech(text, encoded_prompt, num_steps=4)\n\n## save audio\nfinal_wav = final_wav.numpy().squeeze()\nsf.write('output.wav', final_wav, 48000)\n\n## display speech\nif display is not None:\n  display(Audio(final_wav, rate=48000))\n```\n\n#### Inference with sampling params:\n```python\nimport soundfile as sf\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\n\ntext = \"Hey, what's up? I'm feeling really great if you ask me honestly!\"\n\n## change this to your reference file path, can be wav/mp3\nprompt_audio = 'audio_file.wav'\n\nrms = 0.01 ## higher makes it sound louder(0.01 or so recommended)\nt_shift = 0.9 ## sampling param, higher can sound better but worse WER\nnum_steps = 4 ## sampling param, higher sounds better but takes longer(3-4 is best for efficiency)\nspeed = 1.0 ## sampling param, controls speed of audio(lower=slower)\nreturn_smooth = False ## sampling param, makes it sound smoother possibly but less cleaner\nref_duration = 5 ## Setting it lower can speedup inference, set to 1000 if you find artifacts.\n\n## encode audio(takes 10s to init because of librosa first time)\nencoded_prompt = lux_tts.encode_prompt(prompt_audio, duration=ref_duration, rms=rms)\n\n## generate speech\nfinal_wav = lux_tts.generate_speech(text, encoded_prompt, num_steps=num_steps, t_shift=t_shift, speed=speed, return_smooth=return_smooth)\n\n## save audio\nfinal_wav = final_wav.numpy().squeeze()\nsf.write('output.wav', final_wav, 48000)\n\n## display speech\nif display is not None:\n  display(Audio(final_wav, rate=48000))\n```\n## Tips\n- Please use at minimum a 3 second audio file for voice cloning.\n- You can use return_smooth = True if you hear metallic sounds.\n- Lower t_shift for less possible pronunciation errors but worse quality and vice versa.\n\n  \n## Info\n\nQ: How is this different from ZipVoice?\n\nA: LuxTTS uses the same architecture but distilled to 4 steps with an improved sampling technique. It also uses a custom 48khz vocoder instead of the default 24khz version.\n\nQ: Can it be even faster?\n\nA: Yes, currently it uses float32. Float16 should be significantly faster(almost 2x).\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] Release model and code\n- [x] Huggingface spaces demo\n- [x] Release MPS support (thanks to @builtbybasit)\n- [ ] Release LuxTTS v1.5\n- [ ] Release code for float16 inference\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- [ZipVoice](https://github.com/k2-fsa/ZipVoice) for their excellent code and model.\n- [Vocos](https://github.com/gemelo-ai/vocos.git) for their great vocoder.\n  \n## Final Notes\n\nThe model and code are licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.
