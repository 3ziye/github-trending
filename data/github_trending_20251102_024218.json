This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.\n\n## Talk to it\n\nTo get a sense of the endpoint of this repo, you can currently find [nanochat d32](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/8) hosted on [nanochat.karpathy.ai](https://nanochat.karpathy.ai/). \"d32\" means that this model has 32 layers in the Transformer neural network. This model has 1.9 billion parameters, it was trained on 38 billion tokens by simply running the single script [run1000.sh](run1000.sh), and the total cost of training was ~$800 (about 33 hours training time on 8XH100 GPU node). While today this is enough to outperform GPT-2 of 2019, it falls dramatically short of modern Large Language Models like GPT-5. When talking to these micro models, you'll see that they make a lot of mistakes, they are a little bit naive and silly and they hallucinate a ton, a bit like children. It's kind of amusing. But what makes nanochat unique is that it is fully yours - fully configurable, tweakable, hackable, and trained by you from start to end. To train and talk to your own, we turn to...\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script [speedrun.sh](speedrun.sh), which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like [Lambda](https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud)), and kick off the training script:\n\n```bash\nbash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nAlternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session `speedrun` (and also log output to `speedrun.log`):\n\n```bash\nscreen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh\n```\n\nSee the [screen cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jctosta/af918e1618682638aa82) if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with `Ctrl-a d` and `tail speedrun.log` to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run `source .venv/bin/activate`), and serve it:\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.chat_web\n```\n\nAnd then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example [http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/](http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/), etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).\n\n---\n\n<img width=\"2672\" height=\"1520\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed39ddf8-2370-437a-bedc-0f39781e76b5\" />\n\n---\n\nYou can also `cat report.md` file which appeared in the project directory and contains the \"report card\" of the run, i.e. a bunch of evaluations and metrics. At the very end, you'll see a summary table, for example:\n\n---\n\n- Characters: 333,989\n- Lines: 8,304\n- Files: 44\n- Tokens (approx): 83,497\n- Dependencies (uv.lock lines): 2,004\n\n| Metric          | BASE     | MID      | SFT      | RL       |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| CORE            | 0.2219   | -        | -        | -        |\n| ARC-Challenge   | -        | 0.2875   | 0.2807   | -        |\n| ARC-Easy        | -        | 0.3561   | 0.3876   | -        |\n| GSM8K           | -        | 0.0250   | 0.0455   | 0.0758   |\n| HumanEval       | -        | 0.0671   | 0.0854   | -        |\n| MMLU            | -        | 0.3111   | 0.3151   | -        |\n| ChatCORE        | -        | 0.0730   | 0.0884   | -        |\n\nTotal wall clock time: 3h51m\n\n---\n\n(Your table might be missing the RL number by default). For a lot more information around the speedrun script and what to look for and expect, please refer to the walkthrough that I posted in Discussions of the repo: [\"Introducing nanochat: The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy\"](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1).\n\n## Bigger models\n\nUnsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~1",

      "readme": "# Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks\n\nThis is the codebase for the paper: \"Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks\". TRM is a recursive reasoning approach that achieves amazing scores of 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2 using a tiny 7M parameters neural network.\n\n[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871)\n\n### Motivation\n\nTiny Recursion Model (TRM) is a recursive reasoning model that achieves amazing scores of 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2 with a tiny 7M parameters neural network. The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to achieve success on hard tasks is a trap. Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction. With recursive reasoning, it turns out that “less is more”: you don’t always need to crank up model size in order for a model to reason and solve hard problems. A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.\n\nThis work came to be after I learned about the recent innovative Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). I was amazed that an approach using small models could do so well on hard tasks like the ARC-AGI competition (reaching 40% accuracy when normally only Large Language Models could compete). But I kept thinking that it is too complicated, relying too much on biological arguments about the human brain, and that this recursive reasoning process could be greatly simplified and improved. Tiny Recursion Model (TRM) simplifies recursive reasoning to its core essence, which ultimately has nothing to do with the human brain, does not require any mathematical (fixed-point) theorem, nor any hierarchy.\n\n### How TRM works\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://AlexiaJM.github.io/assets/images/TRM_fig.png\" alt=\"TRM\"  style=\"width: 30%;\">\n</p>\n\nTiny Recursion Model (TRM) recursively improves its predicted answer y with a tiny network. It starts with the embedded input question x and initial embedded answer y and latent z. For up to K improvements steps, it tries to improve its answer y. It does so by i) recursively updating n times its latent z given the question x, current answer y, and current latent z (recursive reasoning), and then ii) updating its answer y given the current answer y and current latent z. This recursive process allows the model to progressively improve its answer (potentially addressing any errors from its previous answer) in an extremely parameter-efficient manner while minimizing overfitting.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.10 (or similar)\n- Cuda 12.6.0 (or similar)\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools\npip install --pre --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126 # install torch based on your cuda version\npip install -r requirements.txt # install requirements\npip install --no-cache-dir --no-build-isolation adam-atan2 \nwandb login YOUR-LOGIN # login if you want the logger to sync results to your Weights & Biases (https://wandb.ai/)\n```\n\n### Dataset Preparation\n\n```bash\n# ARC-AGI-1\npython -m dataset.build_arc_dataset \\\n  --input-file-prefix kaggle/combined/arc-agi \\\n  --output-dir data/arc1concept-aug-1000 \\\n  --subsets training evaluation concept \\\n  --test-set-name evaluation\n\n# ARC-AGI-2\npython -m dataset.build_arc_dataset \\\n  --input-file-prefix kaggle/combined/arc-agi \\\n  --output-dir data/arc2concept-aug-1000 \\\n  --subsets training2 evaluation2 concept \\\n  --test-set-name evaluation2\n\n## Note: You cannot train on both ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 and evaluate them both because ARC-AGI-2 training data contains some ARC-AGI-1 eval data\n\n# Sudoku-Extreme\npython dataset/build_sudoku_dataset.py --output-dir data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000  --subsample-size 1000 --num-aug 1000  # 1000 examples, 1000 augments\n\n# Maze-Hard\npython dataset/build_maze_dataset.py # 1000 examples, 8 augments\n```\n\n## Experiments\n\n### ARC-AGI-1 (assuming 4 H-100 GPUs):\n\n```bash\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_arc1concept_4\"\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node 4 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:0 --nnodes=1 pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/arc1concept-aug-1000]\" \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=4 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\n\n```\n\n*Runtime:* ~3 days\n\n### ARC-AGI-2 (assuming 4 H-100 GPUs):\n\n```bash\nrun_name=\"pretrain_att_arc2concept_4\"\ntorchrun --nproc-per-node 4 --rdzv_backend=c10d --rdzv_endpoint=localhost:0 --nnodes=1 pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/arc2concept-aug-1000]\" \\\narch.L_layers=2 \\\narch.H_cycles=3 arch.L_cycles=4 \\\n+run_name=${run_name} ema=True\n\n```\n\n*Runtime:* ~3 days\n\n### Sudoku-Extreme (assuming 1 L40S GPU):\n\n```bash\nrun_name=\"pretrain_mlp_t_sudoku\"\npython pretrain.py \\\narch=trm \\\ndata_paths=\"[data/sudoku-extreme-1k-aug-1000]\" \\\nevaluators=\"[]\" \\\nepochs=50000 eval_interval=5000 \\\nlr=1e-4 puzzle_emb_lr=1e-4 weight_decay=1.0 puzzle",

      "readme": "# Dexter 🤖\n\nDexter is an autonomous financial research agent that thinks, plans, and learns as it works. It performs analysis using task planning, self-reflection, and real-time market data. Think Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.\n\n\n<img width=\"979\" height=\"651\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-10-14 at 6 12 35 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a2859d4-53cf-4638-998a-15cef3c98038\" />\n\n## Overview\n\nDexter takes complex financial questions and turns them into clear, step-by-step research plans. It runs those tasks using live market data, checks its own work, and refines the results until it has a confident, data-backed answer.  \n\nIt’s not just another chatbot.  It’s an agent that plans ahead, verifies its progress, and keeps iterating until the job is done.\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps\n- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data\n- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete\n- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements\n- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution\n\n[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/virattt?style=social)](https://twitter.com/virattt)\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager\n- OpenAI API key (get [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))\n- Financial Datasets API key (get [here](https://financialdatasets.ai))\n\n### Installation\n\n1.

      "readme": "# Kimi CLI\n\n[![Commit Activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/w/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli)](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/graphs/commit-activity)\n[![Checks](https://img.shields.io/github/check-runs/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/main)](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli/actions)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kimi-cli)](https://pypi.org/project/kimi-cli/)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/kimi-cli)](https://pypistats.org/packages/kimi-cli)\n\n[中文](https://www.kimi.com/coding/docs/kimi-cli.html)\n\nKimi CLI is a new CLI agent that can help you with your software development tasks and terminal operations.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Kimi CLI is currently in technical preview.\n\n## Key features\n\n- Shell-like UI and raw shell command execution\n- Zsh integration\n- [Agent Client Protocol] support\n- MCP support\n- And more to come...\n\n[Agent Client Protocol]: https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol\n\n## Installation\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Kimi CLI currently only supports macOS and Linux. Windows support is coming soon.\n\nKimi CLI is published as a Python package on PyPI. We highly recommend installing it with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). If you have not installed uv yet, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to install it first.\n\nOnce uv is installed, you can install Kimi CLI with:\n\n```sh\nuv tool install --python 3.13 kimi-cli\n```\n\nRun `kimi --help` to check if Kimi CLI is installed successfully.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Due to the security checks on macOS, the first time you run `kimi` command may take 10 seconds or more depending on your system environment.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nUpgrade Kimi CLI to the latest version with:\n\n```sh\nuv tool upgrade kimi-cli --no-cache\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun `kimi` command in the directory you want to work on, then send `/setup` to setup Kimi CLI:\n\n![](./docs/images/setup.png)\n\nAfter setup, Kimi CLI will be ready to use. You can send `/help` to get more information.\n\n## Features\n\n### Shell mode\n\nKimi CLI is not only a coding agent, but also a shell. You can switch the mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`. In shell mode, you can directly run shell commands without leaving Kimi CLI.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Built-in shell commands like `cd` are not supported yet.\n\n### Zsh integration\n\nYou can use Kimi CLI together with Zsh, to empower your shell experience with AI agent capabilities.\n\nInstall the [zsh-kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli) plugin via:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/zsh-kimi-cli.git \\\n  ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/kimi-cli\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are using a plugin manager other than Oh My Zsh, you may need to refer to the plugin's README for installation instructions.\n\nThen add `kimi-cli` to your Zsh plugin list in `~/.zshrc`:\n\n```sh\nplugins=(... kimi-cli)\n```\n\nAfter restarting Zsh, you can switch to agent mode by pressing `Ctrl-X`.\n\n### ACP support\n\nKimi CLI supports [Agent Client Protocol] out of the box. You can use it together with any ACP-compatible editor or IDE.\n\nFor example, to use Kimi CLI with [Zed](https://zed.dev/), add the following configuration to your `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"agent_servers\": {\n    \"Kimi CLI\": {\n      \"command\": \"kimi\",\n      \"args\": [\"--acp\"],\n      \"env\": {}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen you can create Kimi CLI threads in Zed's agent panel.\n\n### Using MCP tools\n\nKimi CLI supports the well-established MCP config convention. For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"context7\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.context7.com/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"CONTEXT7_API_KEY\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"chrome-devtools\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"chrome-devtools-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun `kimi` with `--mcp-config-file` option to connect to the specified MCP servers:\n\n```sh\nkimi --mcp-config-file /path/to/mcp.json\n```\n\n## Development\n\nTo develop Kimi CLI, run:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli.git\ncd kimi-cli\n\nmake prepare  # prepare the development environment\n```\n\nThen you can start working on Kimi CLI.\n\nRefer to the following commands after you make changes:\n\n```sh\nuv run kimi  # run Kimi CLI\n\nmake format  # format code\nmake check  # run linting and type checking\nmake test  # run tests\nmake help  # show all make targets\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to Kimi CLI! Please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

      "readme": "# 🍌 Pico-Banana-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Text-Guided Image Editing\n\n<font size=7><div align='center' > [[📖 Paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808)]  </div></font>\n\n**Pico-Banana-400K** is a large-scale dataset of **~400K text–image–edit triplets** designed to advance research in **text-guided image editing**.  \nEach example contains:\n- an **original image** (from [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html)),  \n- a **human-like edit instruction**, and  \n- the **edited result** generated by Nano-Banana and verified by Gemini-2.5-Pro.\n\nThe dataset spans **35 edit operations** across **8 semantic categories**, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.\n\n---\n\n\n\n## 🧩 Key Features\n\n| Feature | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| **Total Samples** | ~257K single-turn text–image–edit triplets for SFT, ~56K single-turn text-image(positive) - image(negative)-edit for preference learning, and ~72K multi-turn texts-images-edits for multi-turn applications|\n| **Source** | [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html) |\n| **Edit Operations** | 35 across 8 semantic categories |\n| **Categories** | Pixel & Photometric, Object-Level, Scene Composition, Stylistic, Text & Symbol, Human-Centric, Scale & Perspective, Spatial/Layout |\n| **Image Resolution** | 512–1024 px |\n| **Prompt Generator** | [Gemini-2.5-Flash](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/) |\n| **Editing Model** | Nano-Banana |\n| **Self-Evaluation** | Automated judging pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Pro for edit quality |\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Dataset Construction\n\nPico-Banana-400K is built using a **two-stage multimodal generation pipeline**:\n\n1. **Instruction Generation**  \n   Each Open Images sample is passed to *Gemini-2.5-Flash*, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B. \n   Example:  \n   ```json\n   {\n     \"instruction\": \"Change the red car to blue.\"\n   }\n   \n\n2. **Editing + Self-Evaluation**\n   The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures:\n   Instruction Compliance (40%)\n   Editing Realism (25%)\n   Preservation Balance (20%)\n   Technical Quality (15%)\n   Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.\n\n## 📊 Dataset Statistics\n\n**Nano-Banana-400K** contains **~400K image editing data**, covering a wide visual and semantic range drawn from real-world imagery.\n\n---\n\n### 🧭 Category Distribution\n\n| Category | Description | Percentage |\n|:----------|:-------------|:------------:|\n| **Object-Level Semantic** | Add, remove, replace, or relocate objects | **35%** |\n| **Scene Composition & Multi-Subject** | Contextual and environmental transformations | **20%** |\n| **Human-Centric** | Edits involving clothing, expression, or appearance | **18%** |\n| **Stylistic** | Domain and artistic style transfer | **10%** |\n| **Text & Symbol** | Edits involving visible text, signs, or symbols | **8%** |\n| **Pixel & Photometric** | Brightness, contrast, and tonal adjustments | **5%** |\n| **Scale & Perspective** | Zoom, viewpoint, or framing changes | **2%** |\n| **Spatial / Layout** | Outpainting, composition, or canvas extension | **2%** |\n\n---\n\n### 📂 Data Composition\n\n- **Single-Turn SFT samples (successful edits):** ~257K  \n- **Single-Turn Preference samples (failure cases):** ~56K\n- **Multi-Turn SFT samples (successful cases):** ~72K  \n- **Gemini-generated instructions:** concise, natural, and image-aware\n- **Edit coverage:** 35 edit types across 8 semantic categories  \n- **Image diversity:** includes humans, objects, text-rich scenes, etc from Open Images  \n\n---\n\n### 🖼️ Visualization\n\nBelow are representative examples from different categories:\n\n| Category | Example |\n|:----------|:---------|\n| Object-Level | “Replace the red apple with a green one.” |\n| Scene Composition | “Add sunlight streaming through the window.” |\n| Human-Centric | “Change the person’s expression to smiling.” |\n| Text & Symbol | “Uppercase the text on the billboard.” |\n| Stylistic | “Convert the image to a Van Gogh painting style.” |\n\n---\n\nPico-Banana-400K provides both **breadth** (diverse edit operations) and **depth** (quality-controlled multimodal supervision), making it a strong foundation for training and evaluating text-guided image editing models.\n\n## 🧠 Applications\n\n**Pico-Banana-400K** serves as a versatile resource for advancing controllable and instruction-aware image editing.  \nBeyond single-step editing, the dataset enables **multi-turn, conversational editing** and **reward-based training paradigms**.\n\n\n\n## 📦 Dataset Download Guide\n\nThe **Pico-Banana-400K** dataset is hosted on Apple’s public CDN.  \nYou ",

Requirements\nPrepare the environment:\n```bash\ncd src\nconda create -n p2v python=3.10\nconda activate p2v\npip install -r requirements.txt\nconda install -c conda-forge tectonic\n```\n**[Optional] [Skip](#2-configure-llms) this part if you do not need a human presenter.**\n\nDownload the dependent code and follow the instructions in **[Hallo2](https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/hallo2)** to download the model weight.\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/hallo2.git\n```\nYou need to **prepare the environment separately for talking-head generation** to potential avoide package conflicts, please refer to  <a href=\"git clone https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/hallo2.git\">Hallo2</a>. After installing, use `which python` to get the python environment path.\n```bash\ncd hallo2\nconda create -n hallo python=3.10\nconda activate hallo\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### 2. Configure LLMs\nExport your **API credentials**:\n```bash\nexport GEMINI_API_KEY=\"your_gemini_key_here\"\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_openai_key_here\"\n```\nThe best practice is to use **GPT4.1** or **Gemini2.5-Pro** for both LLM and VLMs. We also support locally depl",

      "readme": "# DeepSeek-OCR: PDF to Markdown Converter\n\nA powerful OCR solution that converts PDF documents to Markdown format using DeepSeek-OCR with FastAPI backend. This project provides both a batch processing script and a REST API for flexible document conversion.\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n### Option 1: Batch Processing with pdf_to_markdown_processor.py\n\n1. Place your PDF files in the `data/` directory\n2. Ensure the DeepSeek-OCR API is running (see Docker setup below)\n3. Run the processor:\n\n```bash\npython pdf_to_markdown_processor.py\n```\n\n### Option 2: REST API with Docker Backend\n\n1. Build and start the Docker container\n2. Use the API endpoints to process documents\n3. Integrate with your applications\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Prerequisites\n\n### Hardware Requirements\n- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA 11.8+ support\n- **GPU Memory**: Minimum 12GB VRAM (Model takes ~9GB)\n- **System RAM**: Minimum 32GB (recommended: 64GB+)\n- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space for model and containers\n\n### Software Requirements\n- **Python 3.8+** (for local processing)\n- **Docker** 20.10+ with GPU support\n- **Docker Compose** 2.0+\n- **NVIDIA Container Toolkit** installed\n- **CUDA 11.8** compatible drivers\n\n---\n\n## 🐳 Docker Backend Setup\n\n### 1.

It particularly excels in efficient and high-quality long video generation, representing our first step toward world models.\n\n### Key Features\n- 🌟 **Unified architecture for multiple tasks**: LongCat-Video unifies *Text-to-Video*, *Image-to-Video*, and *Video-Continuation* tasks within a single video generation framework. It natively supports all these tasks with a single model and consistently delivers strong performance across each individual task.\n- 🌟 **Long video generation**: LongCat-Video is natively pretrained on *Video-Continuation* tasks, enabling it to produce minutes-long videos without color drifting or quality degradation.\n- 🌟 **Efficient inference**: LongCat-Video generates $720p$, $30fps$ videos within minutes by employing a coarse-to-fine generation strategy along both the temporal and spatial axes. Block Sparse Attention further enhances efficiency, particularly at high resolutions\n- 🌟 **Strong performance with multi-reward RLHF**: Powered by multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), comprehensive evaluations on both internal and public benchmarks demonstrate that LongCat-Video achieves performance comparable to leading open-source video generation models as well as the latest commercial solutions.\n\nFor more detail, please refer to the comprehensive [***LongCat-Video Technical Report***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22200).\n\n## 🎥 Teaser Video\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00fa63f0-9c4e-461a-a79e-c662ad596d7d\" width=\"2264\" height=\"384\"> </video>\n</div>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\nClone the repo:\n\n```shell\ngit clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video\ncd LongCat-Video\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n# create conda environment\nconda create -n longcat-video python=3.10\nconda activate longcat-video\n\n# install torch (configure according to your CUDA version)\npip install torch==2.6.0+cu124 torchvision==0.21.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124\n\n# install flash-attn-2\npip install ninja \npip install psutil \npip install packaging \npip install flash_attn==2.7.4.post1\n\n# install other requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFlashAttention-2 is enabled in the model config by default; you can also change the model config (\"./weights/LongCat-Video/dit/config.json\") to use FlashAttention-3 or xformers once installed.\n\n### Model Download\n\n| Models | Download Link |\n| --- | --- |\n| LongCat-Video | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video) |\n\nDownload models using huggingface-cli:\n```shell\npip install \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\nhuggingface-cli download meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video --local-dir ./weights/LongCat-Video\n```\n\n### Run Text-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_text_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_text_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Image-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_image_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_image_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Video-Continuation\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_video_continuation.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_video_continuation.py --context_parallel_size=2 -",

      "readme": "# MimicKit\n\n\n![Teaser](images/MimicKit_teaser.gif)\n\nThis framework provides a suite of motion imitation methods for training motion controllers. This codebase is designed to be clean and lightweight, with minimal dependencies. A more detailed overview of MimicKit is available in the [Starter Guide](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13794). This codebase includes implementations of:\n- [DeepMimic](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html)\n- [AMP](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AMP/index.html)\n- [ASE](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/ASE/index.html)\n- [ADD](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/ADD/index.html)\n\nWe also include the following RL algorithms:\n- [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)\n- [AWR](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/AWR/index.html)\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall IsaacGym: https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym\n\nInstall requirements:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nDownload assets and motion data from [here](https://1sfu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xbpeng_sfu_ca/EclKq9pwdOBAl-17SogfMW0Bved4sodZBQ_5eZCiz9O--w?e=bqXBaa), then extract the contents into [`data/`](data/).\n\n---\n\n## Training\n\nTo train a model, run the following command:\n```\npython mimickit/run.py --mode train --num_envs 4096 --env_config data/envs/deepmimic_humanoid_env.yaml --agent_config data/agents/deepmimic_humanoid_ppo_agent.yaml --visualize true --log_file output/log.txt --out_model_file output/model.pt\n```\n- `--mode` selects either `train` or `test` mode.\n- `--num_envs` specifies the number of parallel environments used for simulation.\n- `--env_config` specifies the configuration file for the environment.\n- `--agent_config` specifies configuration file for the agent.\n- `--visualize` enables visualization. Rendering should be disabled for faster training.\n- `--log_file` specifies the output log file, which will keep track of statistics during training.\n- `--out_model_file` specifies the output model file, which contains the model parameters.\n- `--logger` specifies the logger used to record training stats. The options are TensorBoard `tb` or `wandb`.\n\nInstead of specifying all arguments through the command line, arguments can also be loaded from an `arg_file`:\n```\npython mimickit/run.py --arg_file args/deepmimic_humanoid_ppo_args.txt --visualize true\n```\nThe arguments in `arg_file` are treated the same as command line arguments. Arguments for all algorithms are provided in [`args/`](args/).\n\n\n## Testing\n\nTo test a model, run the following command:\n```\npython mimickit/run.py --arg_file args/deepmimic_humanoid_ppo_args.txt --num_envs 4 --visualize true --mode test --model_file data/models/deepmimic_humanoid_spinkick_model.pt\n```\n- `--model_file` specifies the `.pt` file that contains the parameters of the trained model. Pretrained models are available in [`data/models/`](data/models/), and the corresponding training log files are available in [`data/logs/`](data/logs/).\n\n\n## Distributed Training\n\nTo use distributed training with multi-CPU or multi-GPU:\n```\npython mimickit/run.py --arg_file args/deepmimic_humanoid_ppo_args.txt --num_workers 2 --device cuda:0\n```\n- `--num_workers` specifies the number of worker processes used to parallelize training. \n- `--device` specifies the device used for training, which can be `cpu` or `cuda:0`. When training with multiple GPUs, the number of worker processes used to parallelize training must be less than or equal to the number of GPUs available on the system.\n\n## Visualizing Training Logs\n\nWhen using the TensorBoard logger during training, a TensorBoard `events` file will be saved the same output directory as the log file. The log can be viewed with:\n```\ntensorboard --logdir=output/ --port=6006 --samples_per_plugin scalars=999999\n```\nThe output log `.txt` file can also be plotted using the plotting script [`plot_log.py`](tools/plot_log/plot_log.py).\n\n---\n\n## Motion Data\nMotion data is stored in [`data/motions/`](data/motions/). The `motion_file` field in the environment configuration file can be used to specify the reference motion clip. In addition to imitating individual motion clips, `motion_file` can also specify a dataset file, located in [`data/datasets/`](data/datasets/), which will train a model to imitate a dataset containing multiple motion clips.\n\nThe `view_motion` environment can be used to visualize motion clips:\n```\npython mimickit/run.py --mode test --arg_file args/view_motion_humanoid_args.txt --visualize true\n```\n\nMotion clips are represented by the `Motion` class implemented in [`motion.py`](mimickit/anim/motion.py). Each motion clip is stored in a `.pkl` file. Each frame in a motion specifies the pose of the character according to\n```\n[root position (3D), root rotation (3D), joint rotations]\n```\nwhere 3D rotations are specified using 3D exponential maps. Joint rotations are recorded in the order that the joints are specified in the `.xml` file (i.e. depth-first traversal of the kinematic tree). For example, in the case of [`humanoid.xml`](data/assets",
