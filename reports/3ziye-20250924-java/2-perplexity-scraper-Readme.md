The [Perplexity Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/serp/perplexity) by Oxylabs allows developers to send prompts to Perplexity and automatically collect both AI-generated responses and structured metadata. Instead of just raw HTML, it can also provide results as parsed JSON, website PNG, XHR/Fetch requests, or Markdown output. 

You can use the [Oxylabs’ Web Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api) with Perplexity for AI content auditing, research tracking, and analyzing SEO performance. It handles dynamic AI-generated content, fully supports real-time SERP extraction, and integrates seamlessly with Oxylabs' global proxy infrastructure, without the need to manage proxies, browsers, or worry about anti-bot systems.

## How it works

The Perplexity scraper handles the rendering, parsing, and delivery of results in any requested format. You need to provide your prompt, credentials, and a few optional parameters, as shown below.

### Request sample (Python)

```python
import json
import requests

# API parameters.
payload = {
    'source': 'perplexity',
    'prompt': 'top 3 smartphones in 2025, compare pricing across US marketplaces',
    'geo_location': 'United States',
    'parse': True
}

# Get a response.
response = requests.post(
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'),
    json=payload
)

# Print response to stdout.
print(response.json())

# Save response to a JSON file.
with open('response.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(response.json(), file, indent=2)
```

More request examples in different programming languages are available [here](https://github.com/oxylabs/perplexity-scraper/tree/main/Code%20examples).

**Note:** By default, all requests to Perplexity use JavaScript rendering. Make sure to set a sufficient timeout (e.g. 180s) when using the Realtime integration method.
