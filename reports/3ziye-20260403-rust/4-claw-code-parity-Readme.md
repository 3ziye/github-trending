> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Rust port is now in progress** on the [`dev/rust`](https://github.com/instructkr/claw-code/tree/dev/rust) branch and is expected to be merged into main today. The Rust implementation aims to deliver a faster, memory-safe harness runtime. Stay tuned — this will be the definitive version of the project.

## Backstory

At 4 AM on March 31, 2026, I woke up to my phone blowing up with notifications. The Claude Code source had been exposed, and the entire dev community was in a frenzy. My girlfriend in Korea was genuinely worried I might face legal action from Anthropic just for having the code on my machine — so I did what any engineer would do under pressure: I sat down, ported the core features to Python from scratch, and pushed it before the sun came up.

The whole thing was orchestrated end-to-end using [oh-my-codex (OmX)](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex) by [@bellman_ych](https://x.com/bellman_ych) — a workflow layer built on top of OpenAI's Codex ([@OpenAIDevs](https://x.com/OpenAIDevs)). I used `$team` mode for parallel code review and `$ralph` mode for persistent execution loops with architect-level verification. The entire porting session — from reading the original harness structure to producing a working Python tree with tests — was driven through OmX orchestration.

The result is a clean-room Python rewrite that captures the architectural patterns of Claude Code's agent harness without copying any proprietary source. I'm now actively collaborating with [@bellman_ych](https://x.com/bellman_ych) — the creator of OmX himself — to push this further. The basic Python foundation is already in place and functional, but we're just getting started. **Stay tuned — a much more capable version is on the way.**

## The Creators Featured in Wall Street Journal For Avid Claude Code Fans

I've been deeply interested in **harness engineering** — studying how agent systems wire tools, orchestrate tasks, and manage runtime context. This isn't a sudden thing. The Wall Street Journal featured my work earlier this month, documenting how I've been one of the most active power users exploring these systems:

> AI startup worker Sigrid Jin, who attended the Seoul dinner, single-handedly used 25 billion of Claude Code tokens last year. At the time, usage limits were looser, allowing early enthusiasts to reach tens of billions of tokens at a very low cost.
>
> Despite his countless hours with Claude Code, Jin isn't faithful to any one AI lab. The tools available have different strengths and weaknesses, he said. Codex is better at reasoning, while Claude Code generates cleaner, more shareable code.
>
> Jin flew to San Francisco in February for Claude Code's first birthday party, where attendees waited in line to compare notes with Cherny. The crowd included a practicing cardiologist from Belgium who had built an app to help patients navigate care, and a California lawyer who made a tool for automating building permit approvals using Claude Code.
>
> "It was basically like a sharing party," Jin said. "There were lawyers, there were doctors, there were dentists. They did not have software engineering backgrounds."

## Porting Status

The main source tree is now Python-first.

- `src/` contains the active Python porting workspace
- `tests/` verifies the current Python workspace
- the exposed snapshot is no longer part of the tracked repository state
