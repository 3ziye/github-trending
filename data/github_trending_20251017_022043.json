It provides a unified interface for executing code across 25 programming languages without the hassle of managing multiple compilers, interpreters, or build tools.\n\nWhether you're a beginner learning your first programming language or an experienced polyglot developer, run streamlines your workflow by providing consistent commands and behavior across all supported languages.\n\n## Who is this for?\n\n• Beginners: Learn programming without worrying about complex setup procedures. Just install run and start coding in any language.\n\n• Students: Quickly test code snippets and experiment with different programming paradigms across multiple languages.\n\n• Developers: Prototype ideas rapidly, test algorithms, and switch between languages seamlessly without context switching.\n\n• DevOps Engineers: Write and test automation scripts in various languages from a single tool.\n\n• Educators: Teach programming concepts across multiple languages with a consistent interface.\n\n## Why was run created?\n\nTraditional development workflows require installing and configuring separate tools for each programming language. This creates several problems:\n\n• Time-consuming setup: Installing compilers, interpreters, package managers, and configuring environments ",

      "readme": "# Firm: Business-as-code\nA text-based work management system for technologists.\n\n![Firm CLI demo](media/demo.gif)\n\n## Why?\nModern businesses are natively digital, but lack a unified view. Your data is scattered across SaaS tools you don't control, so you piece together answers by jumping between platforms.\n\nYour business is a graph: customers link to projects, projects link to tasks, people link to organizations. Firm lets you define these relationships in plain text files (you own!).\n\nVersion controlled, locally stored and structured as code with the Firm DSL. This structured representation of your work, *business-as-code*, makes your business readable to yourself and to the robots that help you run it.\n\n### Features\n- **Everything in one place:** Organizations, contacts, projects, and how they relate.\n- **Own your data:** Plain text files and tooling that runs on your machine.\n- **Open data model:** Tailor to your business with custom schemas.\n- **Automate anything:** Search, report, integrate, whatever. It's just code.\n- **AI-ready:** LLMs can read, write, and query your business structure.\n\n## Installation\nThe Firm CLI is available to download via Github Releases. Install scripts are provided for desktop platforms to make that process easy.\n\n### Linux and macOS\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42futures/firm/main/install.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\n### Windows\n```bash\nirm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42futures/firm/main/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n## Getting started\nFirm operates on a \"workspace\": a directory containing all your `.firm` DSL files. The Firm CLI processes every file in this workspace to build a unified, queryable graph of your business.\n\nThe first step is to add an entity to your workspace. You can do this either by using the CLI or by writing the DSL yourself.\n\n### Add entities with the CLI\nUse `firm add` to interactively generate new entities. Out of the box, Firm supports a set of pre-built entity schemas for org mapping, customer relations and work management. The CLI will prompt you for the necessary info and generate corresponding DSL.\n\n```bash\n$ firm add\n```\n```\nAdding new entity\n\n> Type: organization\n> ID: megacorp\n> Name: Megacorp Ltd.\n> Email: mega@corp.com\n> Urls: [\"corp.com\"]\n\nWriting generated DSL to file my_workspace/generated/organization.firm\n```\n\n### Write DSL manually\nAlternatively, you can create a `.firm` file and write the DSL yourself.\n\n```firm\norganization megacorp {\n  name = \"Megacorp Ltd.\"\n  email = \"mega@corp.com\"\n  urls = [\"corp.com\"]\n}\n```\n\nBoth of these methods achieve the same result: a new entity defined in your Firm workspace.\n\n### Querying the workspace\nOnce you have entities in your workspace, you can query them using the CLI.\n\n#### Listing entities\nUse `firm list` to see all entities of a specific type.\n\n```bash\n$ firm list task\n```\n```\nFound 7 entities with type 'task'\n\nID: task.design_homepage\nName: Design new homepage\nIs completed: false\nAssignee ref: person.jane_doe\n\n...\n```\n\n#### Getting an entity\nTo view the full details of a single entity, use `firm get` followed by the entity's type and ID.\n\n```bash\n$ firm get person john_doe\n```\n```\nFound 'person' entity with ID 'john_doe'\n\nID: person.john_doe\nName: John Doe\nEmail: john@doe.com\n```\n\n#### Exploring relationships\nThe power of Firm lies in its ability to travel a graph of your business. Use `firm related` to explore connections to/from any entity.\n\n```bash\n$ firm related contact john_doe\n```\n```\nFound 1 relationships for 'contact' entity with ID 'john_doe'\n\nID: interaction.megacorp_intro\nType: Call\nSubject: Initial discussion about Project X\nInteraction date: 2025-09-30 09:45:00 +02:00\nInitiator ref: person.jane_smith\nPrimary contact ref: contact.john_doe\n```\n\n#### What's next\nYou've seen the basic commands for interacting with a Firm workspace. The project is a work-in-progress, and you can expect to see more sophisticated features added over time, including a more powerful query engine and tools for running business workflows directly from the CLI.\n\n## Using Firm as a library\nBeyond the CLI, you can integrate Firm's core logic directly into your own software using the `firm_core` and `firm_lang` Rust packages. This allows you to build more powerful automations and integrations on top of Firm.\n\nFirst, add the Firm crates to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nfirm_core = { git = \"https://github.com/42futures/firm.git\" }\nfirm_lang = { git = \"https://github.com/42futures/firm.git\" }\n```\n\nYou can then load a workspace, build the entity graph, and query it programmatically:\n\n```rust\nuse firm_lang::workspace::Workspace;\nuse firm_core::EntityGraph;\n\n// Load workspace from a directory\nlet mut workspace = Workspace::new();\nworkspace.load_directory(\"./my_workspace\")?;\nlet build = workspace.build()?;\n\n// Build the graph from the workspace entities\nlet mut graph = EntityGraph::new();\ngraph.add_entities(build.entities)?;\ngraph.build();\n\n// Query the graph for a specific entity\nlet lead = gr",

I will be releasing updates and\ndevlogs on my [blog](https://fluxsec.red/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FluxSec) to document progress, so please give me a follow there.\n\nWyrm (pronounced 'worm', an old English word for 'serpent' or 'dragon') is a post exploitation, open source, Red Team security testing framework framework, written in Rust designed to be used by Red Teams, Purple Teams, \nPenetration Testers, and general infosec hobbyists. This project is fully built in Rust, with extra effort going into obfuscating artifacts which\ncould be present in memory. Project created and maintained by [flux](https://github.com/0xflux/), for **legal authorised security testing only**.\n\n![Wyrm Malware Post Exploitation Implant Red Team](resources/wyrm_landscape.png)\n\nWyrm currently supports only HTTP(S) agents using a custom encryption scheme for encrypting traffic below TLS, with a unique packet design so that\nthe packets cannot be realistically decrypted even under firewall level TLS inspection.\n\nThis project is a work in progress, currently released at v0.2 (Hatchling). Updates are planned through versions 1,0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0. You can view\nthe planned roadmap in this project (see [Milestones.md](https://github.com/0xflux/Wyrm/blob/master/Milestones.md)). In time, this is designed to be an open source competitor to **Cobalt Strike**, **Mythic**, **Sliver**, etc.\n\nFor any bugs, or feature requests, please use the Issues tab, and for anything else - please use GitHub Discussions. I am active on this project,\nso I will be attentive to anything raised.\n\n### Features\n\n- Implant uses a configurable profile to customise features and configurations\n- IOCs encrypted in the payload to assist in anti-analysis and anti-yara hardening\n- Implant transmits data encrypted below TLS, defeating perimeter inspection security tools out the box\n- Dynamic payload generation\n- Easy mechanism to stage files (such as built implants, PDF, zip, etc) on the C2 for download to support phishing campaigns and initial attack vectors\n- Supports native Windows API commands, more planned in future updates\n- Easy to use terminal client for the operator to task & inspect agents, and to manage staged resources\n- Implant uses the most common User-Agent for comms to help it blend in covertly with traffic by default, this is also configurable to suit your engagement\n- Easy, automated C2 infrastructure deployment with `install_server.sh`\n- Anti-sandbox techniques which are highly configurable by the operator through profiles\n- Backed by a database, fully timestamped to make reporting easier\n\nThis project is not currently accepting contributions, please **raise issues** or use **GitHub Discussions** and I will look into them, and help\nanswer any questions.\n\n**Before deploying the C2**, you should read the C2 readme file, found in the `/c2` directory. Proper docs are coming soon\nin time for v1.0 release, at https://wyrm-c2.com.\n\nA mental model for the C2 is as follows:\n\n![Wyrm C2](resources/c2_model.png)\n\nThe below image demonstrates the **Below TLS Encryption** feature and how it is implemented:\n\n![Wyrm Below TLS Encryption](resources/wyrm_post_diag.png)\n\n### Updates\n\n**WARNING:** Before pulling an update; please check the [release notes](https://github.com/0xflux/Wyrm/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md) to see whether there are any breaking changes - for example if the\n**configurable C2 profile** changes in a breaking way from a previous profile you have, you will want to make sure you backup and migrate\nyour profile. I will be excluding `/c2/profiles/*` from git once the project is published in pre-release to prevent accidentally overwriting\nyour previous profile when running `git pull` to update your software.\n\nAs per the roadmap, this project will see significant development over the next 12 months. To pull updates, whether they are new features\nor bug fixes, you simply just do a git pull, re-build the c2 in release mode via:\n\n- `sudo systemctl stop wyrm`\n- `cd c2`, \n- `cargo build --release`\n- `sudo systemctl start wyrm`\n\n### Setup\n\nThe project contains an install shell script, and is designed to be run on `Debian` based Linux flavours.\nThe install script will install all required dependencies to the project, as well as making a new user, `wyrm_user`\nthat will run the C2 service.\n\nThe user account is created as `sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin wyrm_user`.\n\n**Server Setup**\n\n1) Install your favourite reverse proxy (NGINX / Apache etc). The web app will default to serve on `0.0.0.0` at `:8080`. You can edit this in `/c2/.env` (at step 2), so configure your reverse proxy to use whatever you define in the `.env`.\n2) Clone the repo to your server & mark the install script executable.\n3) **SECURITY**: \n   1) In `c2/.env` edit:\n      1) `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`\n      2) `ADMIN_TOKEN` - **DO NOT USE THE ",

{\n    println!(\"Read: {:?}\", String::from_utf8_lossy(&entry.data));\n}\n```\n\n### Advanced Configuration\n\n```rust\nuse walrus_rust::{Walrus, ReadConsistency, FsyncSchedule};\n\n// Configure with custom consistency and fsync behavior\nlet wal = Walrus::with_consistency_and_schedule(\n    ReadConsistency::AtLeastOnce { persist_every: 1000 },\n    FsyncSchedule::Milliseconds(500)\n)?;\n\n// Write and read operations work the same way\nwal.append_for_topic(\"events\", b\"event data\")?;\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n### Read Consistency Modes\n\nWalrus supports two consistency models:\n\n#### `ReadConsistency::StrictlyAtOnce`\n- **Behavior**: Read offsets are persisted after every read operation\n- **Guarantees**: No message will be read more than once, even after crashes\n- **Performance**: Higher I/O overhead due to frequent persistence\n- **Use Case**: Critical systems where duplicate processing must be avoided\n\n```rust\nlet wal = Walrus::with_consistency(ReadConsistency::StrictlyAtOnce)?;\n```\n\n#### `ReadConsistency::AtLeastOnce { persist_every: u32 }`\n- **Behavior**: Read offsets are persisted every N read operations\n- **Guarantees**: Messages may be re-read after crashes (at-least-once delivery)\n- **Performance**: Better throughput with configurable persistence frequency\n- **Use Case**: High-throughput systems that can handle duplicate processing\n\n```rust\nlet wal = Walrus::with_consistency(\n    ReadConsistency::AtLeastOnce { persist_every: 5000 }\n)?;\n```\n\n### Fsync Scheduling\n\nControl when data is flushed to disk:\n\n#### `FsyncSchedule::Milliseconds(u64)`\n- **Behavior**: Background thread flushes data every N milliseconds\n- **Default**: 1000ms (1 second)\n- **Range**: Minimum 1ms, recommended 100-5000ms\n\n```rust\nlet wal = Walrus::with_consistency_and_schedule(\n    ReadConsistency::AtLeastOnce { persist_every: 1000 },\n    FsyncSchedule::Milliseconds(2000)  // Flush every 2 seconds\n)?;\n```\n\n### Environment Variables\n\n- **`WALRUS_QUIET`**: Set to any value to suppress debug output during operations\n\n```bash\nexport WALRUS_QUIET=1  # Suppress debug messages\n```\n\n## File Structure and Storage\n\nWalrus organizes data in the following structure:\n\n```\nwal_files/\n├── wal_1234567890.log          # Log files (10MB blocks, 100 blocks per file)\n├── wal_1234567891.log\n├── read_offset_idx_index.db    # Persistent read offset index\n└── read_offset_idx_index.db.tmp # Temporary file for atomic updates\n```\n\n### Storage Configuration\n\n- **Block Size**: 10MB per block (configurable via `DEFAULT_BLOCK_SIZE`)\n- **Blocks Per File**: 100 blocks per file (1GB total per file)\n- **Max File Size**: 1GB per log file\n- **Index Persistence**: Read offsets stored in separate index files\n\n## API Reference\n\n### Core Methods\n\n#### `Walrus::new() -> std::io::Result<Self>`\nCreates a new WAL instance with default settings (`StrictlyAtOnce` consistency).\n\n#### `Walrus::with_consistency(mode: ReadConsistency) -> std::io::Result<Self>`\nCreates a WAL with custom consistency mode and default fsync schedule (1000ms).\n\n#### `Walrus::with_consistency_and_schedule(mode: ReadConsistency, schedule: FsyncSchedule) -> std::io::Result<Self>`\nCreates a WAL with full configuration control.\n\n#### `append_for_topic(&self, topic: &str, data: &[u8]) -> std::io::Result<()>`\nAppends data to the specified topic. Topics are created automatically on first write.\n\n#### `read_next(&self, topic: &str) -> std::io::Result<Option<Entry>>`\nReads the next entry from the topic. Returns `None` if",

There are multiple ways to configure the effects and visuals:\n\n**Config files**: Load preset configurations from TOML files. You can find [example preset configs in the `examples` directory](./examples):\n\n```\nchroma -c examples/0.toml\n```\n\n**Live reloading**: Edit your config file while chroma is running and see changes applied instantly! This makes it easy to tweak parameters and visualize your adjustments in real time.\n\n**CLI parameters**: Most parameters can be set via command-line arguments. Run `chroma --help` to see all available options.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can combine config files with CLI parameters—CLI args take precedence. This is perfect when you have a favorite base config but want to tweak specific values on the fly or in a script.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Use `--random` or `-r` to randomize any parameters that haven't been explicitly set by your config file or CLI args. Great for adding variety to each run!\n\nIf you're feeling brave, you can even create your own custom shader patterns and load them like this: `chroma --custom-shader my_shader.wgsl`. Take a look at [`examples/custom_shader.wgsl`](./examples/custom_shader.wgsl) as a beginner template.\n\n## 📦 Dependencies\n\n- Runtime\n  - vulkan-icd-loader\n  - A Vulkan driver: one of `vulkan-intel`, `vulkan-radeon`, or `nvidia-utils`\n  - Terminal with ANSI color support\n- Optional (audio feature)\n  - pipewire (recommended) or alsa-lib\n- Build\n  - rust, cargo, git\n\n## 🏗️ Contributing\n\nAll contributions welcome! If you have some cool ideas, found some bugs, or would like to improve the project anyhow, feel free to create an issue and then a corresponding PR :)\n\nHere's some tips to making good contributions:\n\n- ✅ Create a corresponding issue with a reasonable explanation.\n- ✅ K",

It multiplexes ordered, connection-oriented transports such as TCP, KCP, and TLS-over-TCP into multiple logical concurrent, ordered, bidirectional streams.\n\n![system architecture](https://github.com/Poseidon-fan/net-mux/raw/master/docs/images/architecture.svg)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Examples**\n\n```sh\n$ cargo run --example tcp_server\n$ cargo run --example tcp_client\n```\n\nThis launches a TCP listener on the local loopback address, waiting for client connections. Each connection is wrapped as a mux session. The server and client interact over this single connection through multiple streams. The server receives messages from the client and writes them back unchanged, while the client reads strings from the standard input, sends them to the server, and prints the received messages.\n\n**Links**\n\n- Usage [examples][examples]\n- Released API [Docs][documentation]\n\n[examples]: https://github.com/Poseidon-fan/net-mux/tree/master/examples\n[documentation]: https://docs.rs/crate/net-mux/\n\n## Contribution\n\nThe project is currently under active development, all feedback welcome!\n",

Drop the binary on a host, run it once, and collect actionable leads from the kernel, procfs, bpffs, systemd, cron, sockets, and more.\n\n## Quick start\n\n1. Install a current Rust toolchain.\n2. Build with `cargo build --release`.\n3. Copy `target/release/ghostscan` to the target host.\n4. Run as root (or with equivalent capabilities): `sudo ./ghostscan`.\n5. Optional helpers (`bpftool`, `nft`, `ss`, `journalctl`, `auditctl`) expand coverage; when missing, the output explains what was skipped.\n\n## Reading results\n\n- Each scanner prints a bracketed name followed by either findings, `OK`, or an error string.\n- The process always exits with code `0`; treat the log itself as the verdict.\n- Findings are heuristics designed for triage; validate before acting.\n\n## Available scanners\n\n- **Hidden LKM**: compares procfs/sysfs clusters against `kallsyms` to surface hidden modules.\n- **Kernel taint**: highlights taint flags that lack a visible explanation.\n- **Ftrace redirection**: spots risky `ftrace` hooks on critical kernel paths.\n- **Unknown kprobes**: looks for kprobes attached to sensitive symbols that ghostscan cannot explain.\n- **Syscall table integrity**: verifies syscall table pointers for tampering.\n- **Netfilter hook drift**: finds orphaned or invalid netfilter hook jumps.\n- **Module linkage tamper**: checks module list pointers for manipulation.\n- **Ownerless BPF objects**: reports BPF maps/programs without a backing task.\n- **BPF kprobe attachments**: flags kprobes pointed at high-value kernel routines.\n- **BPF LSM**: notes when BPF LSM programs are active.\n- **Detached XDP/TC programs**: detects XDP or TC programs that no longer have an interface.\n- **Sockmap/Sockhash verdicts**: surfaces sockmap/sockhash programs lacking owners.\n- **Sensitive kfunc usage**: tracks invocations of dangerous `kfunc` targets.\n- **Non-bpffs pins**: finds BPF pins created outside bpffs mounts.\n- **Netlink vs proc**: compares netlink inventories with `/proc/net` to expose hidden sockets.\n- **Task list mismatch**: contrasts BPF snapshots with `/proc` task lists to expose hidden PIDs.\n- **Hidden PIDs**: uses BPF-only views to reveal task IDs invisible to `/proc`.\n- **Kernel thread masquerade**: detects kernel threads spoofing user process metadata.\n- **Suspicious ptrace edges**: reports unusual ptrace parent/child relationships.\n- **Deleted or memfd binaries**: lists processes executing from deleted files or memfd mounts.\n- **Hidden listeners**: identifies listeners seen via netlink vs `/proc` vs BPF.\n- **Ownerless sockets**: reports sockets without an owning task.\n- **Netfilter cloaking**: spots tampering patterns that hide netfilter rules.\n- **Local port backdoors**: highlights sockets bound to deleted or temporary paths.\n- **`ld.so.preload` tamper**: inspects `ld.so.preload` for unexpected entries.\n- **Cron ghosts**: checks cron/anacron/at directories for orphaned or cloaked jobs.\n- **Systemd ghosts**: finds unit files pointing to deleted or temporary executables.\n- **SSH footholds**: surfaces dangerous `authorized_keys` options and forced commands.\n- **OverlayFS whiteouts**: reports suspicious opaque or whiteout entries in OverlayFS.\n- **Hidden bind mounts**: lists bind or immutable mounts likely used for concealment.\n- **PAM/NSS modules**: flags PAM or NSS modules loaded from non-system paths.\n- **Live `LD_PRELOAD`**: notes processes still using deleted or writable preload libraries.\n- **Library search hijack**: checks SUID/privileged binaries for unsafe search paths.\n- **`LD_AUDIT` daemons**: finds daemons configured with `LD_AUDIT` despite lacking TTYs.\n- **Large RX regions**: surfaces non-JIT daemons with large anonymous RX memory.\n- **Kernel text RO**: verifies that kernel text sections remain read-only.\n- **`/etc/scripts.d` provenance**: warns on executable scripts from tmp or non-root owners.\n- **Sudoers**: examines sudoers entries for insecure privilege escalation paths.\n- **Kernel cmdline**: alerts on boot parameters that disable audit, lockdown, or IMA.\n- **Sensitive host mounts**: identifies sensitive host paths exposed inside containers.\n- **Host PID namespace**: reports containers sharing the host PID namespace.\n- **Overlay lowerdir**: catches OverlayFS lowerdirs that escape the storage root.\n- **Audit disabled**: detects when auditd is off or dropping records.\n- **Journal gaps**: looks for missing spans in the current boot's journal.\n- **Kernel message suppression**: notices unusual suppression of kernel logs.\n\n## Development pointers\n\n- Format and lint locally with `cargo fmt && cargo check`.\n- New scanners live in `src/scanners/` and expose `pub fn run() -> ScanOutcome` before being registered in `SCANNERS` inside `src/main.rs`.\n\n## Operational notes\n\n- Most modules require elevated privileges to read privileged interfaces, and they report missing access instead of silently failing.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

This library is intentionally **over-commented**, not because the code is disorganized, but because it's designed to be a **teaching tool**. The goal is elegant, idiomatic Rust code that Rubyists can learn from without the usual compile-pray-repeat cycle.\n\n### Philosophy\n\n- **Learning Ground First**: Extensive inline comments explain Rust concepts, ownership, trait bounds, and macro magic\n- **Ruby Parallels**: Familiar DSL syntax and callbacks make the transition smoother\n- **Production Ready**: Despite the educational focus, this is a fully functional state machine library with:\n  - **Typestate pattern** for compile-time state safety\n  - **Zero-cost abstractions** using PhantomData\n  - Guards and unless conditions\n  - Before/after event callbacks\n  - Sync and async support\n  - `no_std` compatibility (for embedded systems)\n  - Payload support for event data\n  - Move semantics preventing invalid state transitions\n\n### For the Rust Community\n\n**You're welcome to open PRs** to fix fundamentally wrong Rust concepts—but please **don't remove comments just because \"we know it\"**. This codebase serves beginners. If something can be explained better, improve the comment. If a pattern is unidiomatic, fix it *and document why*.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n**Typestate Pattern** – Compile-time state safety using Rust's type system with zero runtime overhead\n\n**Guards & Unless** – Conditional transitions at event and transition levels\n\n**Callbacks** – `before`/`after` hooks at event level\n\n**Around Callbacks** – Wrap transitions with Before/AfterSuccess stages for transaction-like semantics\n\n**Async Support** – First-class `async`/`await` for guards and callbacks\n\n**Event Payloads** – Pass data through transitions with type-safe payloads\n\n**No-std Compatible** – Works on embedded targets (ESP32, bare metal)\n\n**Type-safe** – Invalid transitions become compile errors, not runtime errors\n\n**Hierarchical States** – Superstates with polymorphic transitions via SubstateOf trait\n\n**Dynamic Dispatch** – Runtime event dispatch for event-driven systems (opt-in via feature flag or explicit config)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAdd to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nstate-machines = \"0.1\"\n```\n\n### Basic Example\n\n```rust\nuse state_machines::state_machine;\n\n// Define your state machine\nstate_machine! {\n    name: TrafficLight,\n\n    initial: Red,\n    states: [Red, Yellow, Green],\n    events {\n        next {\n            transition: { from: Red, to: Green }\n            transition: { from: Green, to: Yellow }\n            transition: { from: Yellow, to: Red }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Typestate pattern: each transition returns a new typed machine\n    let light = TrafficLight::new(());\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Red>\n\n    let light = light.next().unwrap();\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Green>\n\n    let light = light.next().unwrap();\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Yellow>\n}\n```\n\n### With Guards and Callbacks\n\n```rust\nuse state_machines::{state_machine, core::GuardError};\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\nstatic DOOR_OBSTRUCTED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);\n\nstate_machine! {\n    name: Door,\n\n    initial: Closed,\n    states: [Closed, Open],\n    events {\n        open {\n            guards: [path_clear],\n            before: [check_safety],\n            after: [log_opened],\n            transition: { from: Closed, to: Open }\n        }\n        close {\n            transition: { from: Open, to: Closed }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<C, S> Door<C, S> {\n    fn path_clear(&self, _ctx: &C) -> bool {\n        !DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.load(Ordering::Relaxed)\n    }\n\n    fn check_safety(&self) {\n        println!(\"Checking if path is clear...\");\n    }\n\n    fn log_opened(&self) {\n        println!(\"Door opened at {:?}\", std::time::SystemTime::now());\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Successful transition\n    let door = Door::new(());\n    let door = door.open().unwrap();\n    let door = door.close().unwrap();\n\n    // Failed guard check\n    DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);\n    let err = door.open().expect_err(\"should fail when obstructed\"",

It's frustrating to figure out what those packages do without copy/pasting their names into [brew.sh](https://brew.sh) and only then discovering what they're good for.  \n\nThat's why I created **Brew Explorer** - a little app that makes it easy to understand what formulaes and casks you have installed on your system.   \nPlus, you can quickly **uninstall old useless things** and **update whatever was left behind** - all from within the same interface!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Loading Screen\n![Loading Screen](.resources/loading_screen.png)\n\n### Main Screen\n\n![Main Screen](.resources/main_screen.png)\n\n### Search and Uninstall\n\n![Uninstall](.resources/uninstall.png)\n\n## Features\n\n✨ **Appealing TUI** - Clean, intuitive terminal interface with ASCII art  \n🔍 **Search functionality** - Quickly find packages by name  \n📦 **Package details** - View descriptions, homepages, versions, and more  \n🔄 **Update packages** - Update outdated packages with a single keystroke  \n🗑️ **Uninstall packages** - Remove packages you no longer need  \n🎨 **Color-coded status** - Green for up-to-date, red for outdated packages  \n⚡ **Fast navigation** - Multi-column layout for efficient browsing  \n🚀 **Auto-sync** - Runs `brew update` on startup for fresh package information\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- macOS (Homebrew is macOS-specific)\n- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed\n\n### Steps\n\n```shell\nbrew tap cosmincatalin/tap\nbrew install brew-explorer\n```\n\n### Navigation\n\n- **↑/↓** - Move up/down in the package list\n- **←/→** - Move left/right between columns\n- **PgUp/PgDn** - Jump by pages\n- **Home/End** - Jump to first/last package\n\n### Actions\n\n- **/** - Start searching for packages\n- **u** - Update the selected package\n- **x** - Uninstall the selected package\n- **q** - Quit the application\n\n### Search Mode\n\n- Type any character to search for packages by name\n- **Enter** or **Esc** - Exit search and return to browsing\n- Navigation keys (↑/↓/←/→) still work while searching\n",

      "readme": "# Codex ACP Agent\n\n[![MSRV](https://img.shields.io/badge/MSRV-1.90%2B-blue.svg)](rust-toolchain.toml)\n[![Edition](https://img.shields.io/badge/Edition-2024-blueviolet.svg)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2024/index.html)\n\n> Most of this repository code is implemented and reviewed by `codex` agents.\n\nAn Agent Client Protocol (ACP)–compatible agent that bridges the OpenAI Codex runtime with ACP clients over stdio. This project is under active development — features are evolving and breaking changes are likely.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Agent Client Protocol (ACP) over stdio using `agent-client-protocol`.\n- Integrates with the Codex Rust workspace for conversation management and event streaming.\n- Slash commands with ACP AvailableCommands updates (advertised to clients on session start).\n- Status output tailored for IDEs (workspace, account, model, token usage).\n- Supports ACP session modes: `read-only`, `auto` (default), and `full-access`.\n- Automatically launches an internal MCP filesystem server (`acp_fs`) so Codex reads/writes files through ACP tooling instead of shell commands.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Rust (Rust 2024 edition; rustc 1.90+ as pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`).\n- Network access for building Git dependencies (Codex workspace, ACP crate).\n\n## Build\n\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\n## Run\n\nThe agent communicates over stdin/stdout using ACP JSON-RPC. Launch it and connect from an ACP client (e.g., an IDE integration or a CLI client implementing ACP):\n\n```bash\n# With tracing logs\nRUST_LOG=info cargo run --quiet\n```\n\nBecause this agent speaks on stdio, it is intended to be spawned by your client. For manual testing, you can pipe ACP JSON-RPC messages to stdin and read replies from stdout.\n\n> Tip: use `make release` (or `cargo build --release`) when shipping the binary to an IDE like Zed. The release build lives at `target/release/codex-acp`.\n\nExample JSON-RPC (initialize → new session → /status):\n\n```\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"initialize\",\"params\":{\"protocolVersion\":\"v1\",\"clientName\":\"cli\",\"capabilities\":{}}}\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"session/new\",\"params\":{\"cwd\":\"/absolute/path\",\"mcpServers\":[]}}\n{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"session/prompt\",\"params\":{\"sessionId\":\"1\",\"prompt\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"/status\"}]}}\n```\n\n## Usage (ACP over stdio)\n\nMinimal smoke test from a shell piping JSON-RPC over stdio:\n\n```bash\nprintf '%s\\n' \\\n  '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":1,\"method\":\"initialize\",\"params\":{\"protocolVersion\":\"v1\",\"clientName\":\"cli\",\"capabilities\":{}}}' \\\n  '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":2,\"method\":\"session/new\",\"params\":{\"cwd\":\"'\"$PWD\"'\",\"mcpServers\":[]}}' \\\n  '{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":3,\"method\":\"session/prompt\",\"params\":{\"sessionId\":\"1\",\"prompt\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"text\":\"/status\"}]}}' \\\n| RUST_LOG=info cargo run --quiet\n```\n\nOr use the included script and Makefile target:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x scripts/stdio-smoke.sh\nmake smoke\n```\n\n### Configuration in [Zed](https://zed.dev)\n\n> Add this configuration to zed settings.\n```json\n\"agent_servers\": {\n  \"Codex\": {\n    \"command\": \"codex-acp\",\n    \"args\": [],\n    \"env\": {\n      \"RUST_LOG\": \"info\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe agent automatically boots an MCP filesystem bridge. No extra configuration (or AGENTS.md edits) are required—Codex will discover the `acp_fs` server on every session.\n\n## Filesystem tooling\n\nWhen a session starts, `codex-acp` spins up an in-process TCP bridge and registers an MCP server named `acp_fs`. Codex then calls two structured tools:\n\n- `read_text_file` — reads workspace files via ACP `client.read_text_file`, falling back to local disk if the client lacks FS support.\n- `write_text_file` — writes workspace files via ACP `client.write_text_file`, with a local fallback.\n\n`codex-acp` also injects a default instruction reminding the model to use these tools rather than shelling out with `cat`/`tee`. If your client exposes filesystem capabilities, file access stays within ACP.\n\n## Plan Updates\n\nWhen Codex emits plan updates (step lists with statuses), the agent translates them into ACP `SessionUpdate::Plan` events. Clients receive structured plan entries with status mapping:\n\n- Pending → `pending`\n- InProgress → `in_progress`\n- Completed → `completed`\n\nThe agent preserves ordering and includes any optional explanation text. This allows IDEs to render a live task checklist during long-running operations.\n\n## Features\n\n- ACP Agent implementation\n  - Handles `initialize`, `authenticate` (API key), `session/new`, `session/prompt`, `session/cancel`.\n  - Streams Codex events (assistant text and deltas, reasoning deltas, token counts) as `session/update` notifications.\n\n- Slash commands (advertised via `AvailableCommandsUpdate`)\n  - Implemented today:\n    - `/new` — Start a new chat during a conversation.\n    - `/init` — Create an `AGENTS.md` with repository contributor guidance. Uses a bundled prompt (`src/agent/prompt_init_command.md`).\n    - `/model` — Show or set the current model (uses `Op::OverrideTurnContext`).\n    - `/approvals` — Set approval mode ",
