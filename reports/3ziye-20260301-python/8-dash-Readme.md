# Dash

Dash is a **self-learning data agent** that grounds its answers in **6 layers of context** and improves with every run.

Inspired by [OpenAI's in-house data agent](https://openai.com/index/inside-our-in-house-data-agent/).

## Get Started

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/agno-agi/dash.git && cd dash

# Add OPENAI_API_KEY
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and add your key

# Start the application
docker compose up -d --build

# Load sample data and knowledge
docker exec -it dash-api python -m dash.scripts.load_data
docker exec -it dash-api python -m dash.scripts.load_knowledge
```

Confirm dash is running at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## Connect to the Web UI

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and login
2. Add OS → Local → `http://localhost:8000`
3. Click "Connect"

**Try it** (sample F1 dataset):

- Who won the most F1 World Championships?
- How many races has Lewis Hamilton won?
- Compare Ferrari vs Mercedes points 2015-2020

## Why Text-to-SQL Breaks in Practice

Our goal is simple: ask a question in english, get a correct, meaningful answer. But raw LLMs writing SQL hit a wall fast:

- **Schemas lack meaning.**
- **Types are misleading.**
- **Tribal knowledge is missing.**
- **No way to learn from mistakes.**
- **Results generally lack interpretation.**

The root cause is missing context and missing memory.

Dash solves this with **6 layers of grounded context**, a **self-learning loop** that improves with every query, and a focus on **understanding your question** to deliver insights you can act on.

## The Six Layers of Context

| Layer | Purpose | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Table Usage** | Schema, columns, relationships | `knowledge/tables/*.json` |
| **Human Annotations** | Metrics, definitions, and business rules | `knowledge/business/*.json` |
| **Query Patterns** | SQL that is known to work | `knowledge/queries/*.sql` |
| **Institutional Knowledge** | Docs, wikis, external references | MCP (optional) |
| **Learnings** | Error patterns and discovered fixes | Agno `Learning Machine` |
| **Runtime Context** | Live schema changes | `introspect_schema` tool |

The agent retrieves relevant context at query time via hybrid search, then generates SQL grounded in patterns that already work.

## The Self-Learning Loop

Dash improves without retraining or fine-tuning. We call this gpu-poor continuous learning.

It learns through two complementary systems:

| System | Stores | How It Evolves |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Knowledge** | Validated queries and business context | Curated by you + dash |
| **Learnings** | Error patterns and fixes | Managed by `Learning Machine` automatically |

**Knowledge** is curated—validated queries and business context you want the agent to build on.

**Learnings** is discovered—patterns the agent finds through trial and error. When a query fails because `position` is TEXT not INTEGER, the agent saves that gotcha. Next time, it knows.

## Insights, Not Just Rows

Dash reasons about what makes an answer useful, not just technically correct.

**Question:**
Who won the most races in 2019?

| Typical SQL Agent | Dash |
|------------------|------|
| `Hamilton: 11` | Lewis Hamilton dominated 2019 with **11 wins out of 21 races**, more than double Bottas’s 4 wins. This performance secured his sixth world championship. |

## Deploy to Railway

```sh
railway login

./scripts/railway_up.sh
```

### Production Operations

**Load data and knowledge:**
```sh
railway run python -m dash.scripts.load_data
railway run python -m dash.scripts.load_knowledge
```

**View logs:**

```sh
railway logs --service dash
```

**Run commands in production:**

```sh
railway run python -m dash  # CLI mode
```

**Redeploy after changes:**

```sh
railway up --service dash -d
```

**Open dashboard:**
```sh
railway open
```

## Adding Knowledge

Dash works best when it understands how your organization talks about data.

```
knowledge/
├── tables/      # Table meaning and caveats
├── queries/     # Proven SQL patterns
└── business/    # Metrics and language
```

### Table Metadata

```
{
  "table_name": "orders",
  "table_description": "Customer orders with denormalized line items",
  "use_cases": ["Revenue reporting", "Customer analytics"],
  "data_quality_notes": [
    "created_at is UTC",
    "status values: pending, completed, refunded",
    "amount stored in cents"
  ]
}
```

### Query Patterns

```
-- <query name>monthly_revenue</query name>
-- <query description>
-- Monthly revenue calculation.
-- Converts cents to dollars.
-- Excludes refunded orders.
-- </query description>
