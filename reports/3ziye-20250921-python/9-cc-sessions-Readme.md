## 🔥 The Problem

<details>
<summary><strong>How you got here</strong> <em>(click to read the painful journey)</em></summary>

<br>

I'm going to guess how you got here and you can tell me if I get it right:

- 💭 The LLM programmer hype gave you a nerd chub  
- 😬 The people hyping LLM programming made your nerd chub crawl back into your body <br> <sup>_(are you ready to 'scale your impact', dog?)_</sup> 
- 🤮 You held your nose and downloaded Cursor/added Cline or Roo Code/npm installed Claude Code

At first this was obviously novel and interesting. Some things were shitty but mostly you were enjoying not having to write a context manager or even recognize that you needed one for your dumb client wrapper.

**You were _scaling_ your _impact_** _(whew)_.

But then Claude started doing some concerning things. 

You asked it to add error handling to **one** function. It added error handling to **_every function in the file_**. And changed your error types. And your logging format. And somehow your indentation is different now?

The context window thing started getting annoying. You're explaining the same architecture for the fifth time today. Claude's like _'let me look for the database'_ **Brother. We've been using Postgres for six hours. You were just in there.**

Your CLAUDE.md is now longer than your actual code. 
- `'NEVER use class components.'` 
- `'ALWAYS use the existing auth middleware.'` 
- `'DO NOT refactor unrelated code.'` 
- `'REMEMBER we use PostgreSQL.'` 

Claude reads the first line and then macrodoses window pane LSD for the rest.

You tried the subagents, but quickly realized that **you can't even talk to these things.** 10 minutes into a "code review" and the agent hits some kind of API error and returns to your main thread with no explanation of what it did or what it discovered. 

Run it again, I guess? 

_This fucking sucks_.

Now you're here. Your codebase is 'done' but you couldn't, in a million years, explain what that means or how it satisfies the definition. 

There's three different global clients for the same database connection and two of them use hallucinated environment variables (the other just yeets your client secret into the service code). 

You've got utility functions that are duplicated in four files because Claude kept forgetting they exist.

20% of your code lines are comments explaining why something *isn't* there and *is* somewhere else.

You don't even know exactly what's wrong and fixing it means understanding code you didn't write in patterns you don't recognize using approaches you wouldn't choose.

### **Are you scaling your impact yet?**

## 💊 The Solution

<details>
<summary><strong>What We Fixed</strong> <em>(what you get when you use cc-sessions)</em></summary>

<br>

So, now you're here. Since this is exclusively about Claude Code I'm going to assume that you are a CC user and you are looking to make that better. **Lit.**

Let's talk about Claude Code.

Of the major AI programming IDEs/scaffolds, Claude Code is probably the best and Claude models are probably the best _(though Google is kinda coming for that ass)_.

But, Claude Code is not without its **major faults, flaws, and flaccidity-inducing frustrations**.

For instance, **it would be nice if**:

- Claude had to talk to you before writing code so you didn't end up with 500 lines of implementation for a one-line change.

- you didn't lose everything when the context window died and Claude actually remembered what you were working on tomorrow.

- you didn't have to explain your entire architecture every. single. session. and Claude actually inherited understanding from previous work.

- Claude couldn't randomly refactor working code while you're trying to add a button.

- you didn't have to manually check which branch you're on in five different repos and Claude actually stopped you before you edited the wrong one.

- Claude followed the patterns in your codebase instead of inventing new ones every time it touches a file.

- you didn't have to write increasingly desperate rules in CLAUDE.md and Claude was actually forced to follow consistent behavior.

### **This is what Sessions does.**

It makes all of these n
