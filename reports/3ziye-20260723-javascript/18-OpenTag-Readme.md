OpenTag brings AI agents into the place where team work already happens: Slack channels and threads.

Instead of running an agent from one person's terminal and pasting results back into chat, a team can mention `@OpenTag`, discuss the task in the same thread, approve risky actions when needed, and keep the outcome visible to everyone who has access to that channel.

---

## ✨ What You Can Do

- Ask an agent to investigate a bug from a Slack thread.
- Let teammates add context before or during the agent run.
- Route work to different agent backends such as Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Docker-based agents, HTTP agents, or custom CLIs.
- Teach OpenTag an explicit team fact, decision, convention, preference, or procedure; corrections are versioned, scoped, sourced, and reused by every configured runtime.
- Use Channel Profiles / Access Bundles so different projects can have different permissions, memories, default agents, and run limits.
- Require approvals before write actions or risky operations.
- Keep a record of sessions, decisions, outputs, and generated artifacts.

OpenTag is designed for team workflows where context, permission, and accountability matter.

## 💬 How It Feels In Slack

```text
@OpenTag summarize why this deployment failed

@OpenTag check this thread and draft the fix plan

/runtime codex-readonly explain the current project structure

/opentag sessions
/opentag approvals
/opentag status <session_id>
```

The agent replies in the same Slack thread, so the work stays connected to the original discussion.

## 🚀 Why OpenTag

Most AI coding and automation tools are built around a single local operator. OpenTag is built around shared channels.

- **Shared by default**: the conversation, context, and result stay in the team thread.
- **Channel-aware**: each channel can have its own project, instructions, memory, permissions, default runtime, and run limits.
- **Shared team knowledge**: correct a fact once and future threads receive the latest active version, with provenance and revision history under your control.
- **Agent-flexible**: use the agent runtime that fits the task instead of locking the team into one backend.
- **Approval-ready**: sensitive actions can pause for human review.
- **Auditable**: sessions, messages, approvals, outputs, and artifacts can be reviewed later.

## ⚡ Quick Start

OpenTag requires Node.js `>=20.11.0`.

```bash
npm install
npm run smoke
```

Try OpenTag locally without Slack:

```bash
npm run start:console
```

Start the Slack gateway with the example configuration:

```bash
npm link
opentag init --project . --runtime mock --open-slack
opentag setup launch
opentag doctor --strict
```

`opentag setup launch` starts the local daemon when needed and opens a step-by-step setup wizard at `http://127.0.0.1:8787/setup`. The wizard walks through agent selection, Slack manifest import, local token saving, and final verification.

Run this any time to see the next setup step:

```bash
opentag next
```

For detailed Slack setup, start with:

- [`docs/user-guide/01-install.md`](docs/user-guide/01-install.md)
- [`examples/slack-app-manifest.yaml`](examples/slack-app-manifest.yaml)
