      "readme": "# deepseek-ocr.rs 🚀\n\nRust implementation of the DeepSeek-OCR inference stack with a fast CLI and an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. The workspace packages the vision-language model, prompt tooling, and serving layer so you can build document understanding pipelines that run locally on CPU, Apple Metal, or (alpha) NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.\n\n> 中文文档请看 [README_CN.md](README_CN.md)。  \n\n> Want ready-made binaries? Latest macOS (Metal-enabled) and Windows bundles live in the [build-binaries workflow artifacts](https://github.com/TimmyOVO/deepseek-ocr.rs/actions/workflows/build-binaries.yml). Grab them from the newest green run.\n\n## Inside `crates/core` 🔬\n\n- **Vision preprocessing** – `prepare_vision_input_from_image` builds a square global canvas with letterboxing (`build_global_view`) and, when crop mode is enabled, applies `dynamic_preprocess` tiling to produce high-resolution local crops plus optional thumbnails.\n- **SAM + CLIP fusion** – each view is normalised via `image_to_tensor`, pushed through the Candle ports of SAM (`SamBackbone`) and CLIP-L (`ClipVisionModel`), then flattened with `build_clip_sam_tokens` so the features stay spatially aligned.\n- **Projector & layout tokens** – the custom `ImageProjector` linearly maps concatenated SAM/CLIP channels into the language hidden size while injecting learned `image_newline`/`view_separator` tokens to preserve grid structure, yielding the multimodal embeddings used during decoding.\n- **Tokenizer alignment** – `build_prompt_tokens` synthesises `<image>` spans whose length exactly matches the projected token count (global + local grids), ensuring OpenAI-style prompts remain consistent even after chat history pruning.\n- **Decoder & caching** – the text stack is a Candle reimplementation of DeepSeek-V2 (`DeepseekLanguageModel`) with optional FlashAttention, rotary position embeddings, and `DynamicCache` guards so both the CLI and server can stream tokens efficiently.\n- **Observability & parity** – debug builds expose CLIP/SAM traces (`VisionDebugFeatures`) so we can diff intermediate tensors against the PyTorch reference; most stages are already numerically aligned, and the few remaining deltas (mainly projector normalisation + vision tiling) are tracked on the roadmap for upcoming releases.\n\n## Why Rust? 💡\n\nThe original DeepSeek-OCR ships as a Python + Transformers stack—powerful, but hefty to deploy and awkward to embed. Rewriting the pipeline in Rust gives us:\n\n- Smaller deployable artifacts with zero Python runtime or conda baggage.\n- Memory-safe, thread-friendly infrastructure that blends into native Rust backends.\n- Unified tooling (CLI + server) running on Candle + Rocket without the Python GIL overhead.\n- Drop-in compatibility with OpenAI-style clients while tuned for single-turn OCR prompts.\n\n## Technical Stack ⚙️\n\n- **Candle** for tensor compute, with Metal and CUDA backends and FlashAttention support.\n- **Rocket** + async streaming for OpenAI-compatible `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.\n- **tokenizers** (upstream DeepSeek release) wrapped by `crates/assets` for deterministic caching via Hugging Face and ModelScope mirrors.\n- **Pure Rust vision/prompt pipeline** shared by CLI and server to avoid duplicated logic.\n\n## Advantages over the Python Release 🥷\n\n- Faster cold-start on Apple Silicon, lower RSS, and native binary distribution.\n- Deterministic dual-source (Hugging Face + ModelScope) asset download + verification built into the workspace.\n- Automatic single-turn chat compaction so OCR outputs stay stable even when clients send history.\n- Ready-to-use OpenAI compatibility for tools like Open WebUI without adapters.\n\n## Highlights ✨\n\n- **One repo, two entrypoints** – a batteries-included CLI for batch jobs and a Rocket-based server that speaks `/v1/responses` and `/v1/chat/completions`.\n- **Works out of the box** – pulls model weights, configs, and tokenizer from whichever of Hugging Face or ModelScope responds fastest on first run.\n- **Optimised for Apple Silicon** – optional Metal backend with FP16 execution for real-time OCR on laptops.\n- **CUDA (alpha)** – experimental support via `--features cuda` + `--device cuda --dtype f16`; expect rough edges while we finish kernel coverage.\n- **Intel MKL (preview)** – faster BLAS on x86 via `--features mkl` (install Intel oneMKL beforehand).\n- **OpenAI client compatibility** – drop-in replacement for popular SDKs; the server automatically collapses chat history to the latest user turn for OCR-friendly prompts.\n\n## Quick Start 🏁\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Rust 1.78+ (edition 2024 support)\n- Git\n- Optional: Apple Silicon running macOS 13+ for Metal acceleration\n- Optional: CUDA 12.2+ toolkit + driver for experimental NVIDIA GPU acceleration on Linux/Windows\n- Optional: Intel oneAPI MKL for preview x86 acceleration (see below)\n- (Recommended) Hugging Face account with `HF_TOKEN` when pulling from the `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR` repo (ModelScope is used automatically when it’s faster/reachable).\n\n### Clone the Worksp",

      "readme": "# Firm: Business-as-code\nA text-based work management system for technologists.\n\n![Firm CLI demo](media/demo.gif)\n\n## Why?\nModern businesses are natively digital, but lack a unified view. Your data is scattered across SaaS tools you don't control, so you piece together answers by jumping between platforms.\n\nYour business is a graph: customers link to projects, projects link to tasks, people link to organizations. Firm lets you define these relationships in plain text files (you own!).\n\nVersion controlled, locally stored and structured as code with the Firm DSL. This structured representation of your work, *business-as-code*, makes your business readable to yourself and to the robots that help you run it.\n\n### Features\n- **Everything in one place:** Organizations, contacts, projects, and how they relate.\n- **Own your data:** Plain text files and tooling that runs on your machine.\n- **Open data model:** Tailor to your business with custom schemas.\n- **Automate anything:** Search, report, integrate, whatever. It's just code.\n- **AI-ready:** LLMs can read, write, and query your business structure.\n\n## Getting started\nFirm operates on a \"workspace\": a directory containing all your `.firm` DSL files. The Firm CLI processes every file in this workspace to build a unified, queryable graph of your business.\n\nThe first step is to add an entity to your workspace. You can do this either by using the CLI or by writing the DSL yourself.\n\n### Add entities with the CLI\nUse `firm add` to interactively generate new entities. Out of the box, Firm supports a set of pre-built entity schemas for org mapping, customer relations and work management. The CLI will prompt you for the necessary info and generate corresponding DSL.\n\n```bash\n$ firm add\n```\n```\nAdding new entity\n\n> Type: organization\n> ID: megacorp\n> Name: Megacorp Ltd.\n> Email: mega@corp.com\n> Urls: [\"corp.com\"]\n\nWriting generated DSL to file my_workspace/generated/organization.firm\n```\n\n### Write DSL manually\nAlternatively, you can create a `.firm` file and write the DSL yourself.\n\n```firm\norganization megacorp {\n  name = \"Megacorp Ltd.\"\n  email = \"mega@corp.com\"\n  urls = [\"corp.com\"]\n}\n```\n\nBoth of these methods achieve the same result: a new entity defined in your Firm workspace.\n\n### Querying the workspace\nOnce you have entities in your workspace, you can query them using the CLI.\n\n#### Listing entities\nUse `firm list` to see all entities of a specific type.\n\n```bash\n$ firm list task\n```\n```\nFound 7 entities with type 'task'\n\nID: task.design_homepage\nName: Design new homepage\nIs completed: false\nAssignee ref: person.jane_doe\n\n...\n```\n\n#### Getting an entity\nTo view the full details of a single entity, use `firm get` followed by the entity's type and ID.\n\n```bash\n$ firm get person john_doe\n```\n```\nFound 'person' entity with ID 'john_doe'\n\nID: person.john_doe\nName: John Doe\nEmail: john@doe.com\n```\n\n#### Exploring relationships\nThe power of Firm lies in its ability to travel a graph of your business. Use `firm related` to explore connections to/from any entity.\n\n```bash\n$ firm related contact john_doe\n```\n```\nFound 1 relationships for 'contact' entity with ID 'john_doe'\n\nID: interaction.megacorp_intro\nType: Call\nSubject: Initial discussion about Project X\nInteraction date: 2025-09-30 09:45:00 +02:00\nInitiator ref: person.jane_smith\nPrimary contact ref: contact.john_doe\n```\n\n## Installation\nThe Firm CLI is available to download via [Github Releases](https://github.com/42futures/firm/releases/). Install scripts are provided to make the process easy.\n\n### Linux and macOS\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42futures/firm/main/install.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\nIf you don't feel confident running it with `sudo`, you can:\n\n1. **Download the release**\n   - Go to [Github Releases](https://github.com/42futures/firm/releases/)\n   - Download the appropriate archive for your operating system and architecture. You can run `uname -m` in your terminal if you're not sure which one to pick.\n\n2. **Extract the archive**\n```bash\ntar -xzf firm-[OS]-[ARCH].tar.gz\n```\n\n3. **Navigate to the extracted directory**\n```bash\ncd firm-[OS]-[ARCH]\n```\n\n4. **Run the application**\n\n**Option A:** Run from current directory\n```bash\n./firm\n```\n\n**Option B:** Install globally (recommended)\n```bash\n# Make executable (if needed)\nchmod +x firm\n\n# Move to system PATH\nsudo mv firm /usr/local/bin/\n\n# Now you can run firm from anywhere\nfirm\n```\n\n### Windows\n```bash\nirm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/42futures/firm/main/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n## Using Firm as a library\nBeyond the CLI, you can integrate Firm's core logic directly into your own software using the `firm_core` and `firm_lang` Rust packages. This allows you to build more powerful automations and integrations on top of Firm.\n\nFirst, add the Firm crates to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nfirm_core = { git = \"https://github.com/42futures/firm.git\" }\nfirm_lang = { git = \"https://github.com/42futures/firm.git\" }\n```\n\nYou can then l",

Three-Tier Bad Debt Defense (O(1))\n\nWhen liquidations create bad debt, the protocol uses a three-tier defense mechanism to socialize losses across winners without iterating over users.\n\n**Loss Waterfall**:\n1. **Insurance Fund** (first line of defense)\n   - Separate vault PDA controlled by insurance authority\n   - Accrues fees from trades\n   - Pays out during liquidations with bad debt\n   - Configurable authority for topup/withdrawal\n   - Hard caps: per-event payout (0.5% of OI) and daily limit (3% of vault)\n\n2. **Warming PnL** (second line of defense)\n   - Burns unvested profits from users\n   - Only after insurance exhausted\n\n3. **Equity Haircut** (final resort)\n   - Global scale factor applied to all users\n   - Only after insurance AND warmup exhausted\n   - Haircut = (deficit - insurance - warmup) / total_equity\n\n```rust\nuse model_safety::crisis::*;\n\n// Example: 150 SOL bad debt, 50 SOL insurance, 800 SOL equity\nlet mut accums = Accums::new();\naccums.sigma_principal = 800_000_000_000;        // 800 SOL\naccums.sigma_collateral = 650_000_000_000;      // 650 SOL (150 SOL deficit)\naccums.sigma_insurance = 50_000_000_000;        // 50 SOL\n\nlet outcome = crisis_apply_haircuts(&mut accums);\n\n// Result:\n// - Insurance drawn: 50 SOL (exhausted completely)\n// - Remaining deficit: 100 SOL\n// - Haircut ratio: 100 / 800 = 12.5%\n// - User with 300 SOL → keeps 262.5 SOL (loses 37.5",

It works for basic use cases but hasn't been thoroughly tested. Things might break, APIs might change, and there are probably bugs. Tested primarily on macOS – not sure if it works properly on Linux and Windows due to webview differences.\n\n## About\n\nPipedash aggregates CI/CD pipelines from multiple providers into a single desktop interface. Instead of switching between GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Buildkite, Jenkins, and Tekton dashboards, view everything in one place.\n\nBuilt with Tauri, Rust, React, and TypeScript.\n\n## Why\n\nMost development teams use multiple CI/CD platforms over time. Open source projects often use GitHub Actions, internal services might run on GitLab CI or Buildkite, Kubernetes-native workloads use Tekton, and there's usually some Jenkins instance handling legacy systems. Checking everything means opening multiple tabs and manually refreshing.\n\nThis tool pulls pipeline data from different providers and shows it together.\n\n## Supported Providers\n\n- GitHub Actions\n- GitLab CI\n- Buildkite\n- Jenkins\n- Tekton CD\n\nThe plugin architecture allows adding more providers.\n\n## What It Does\n\nThe app polls configured providers and displays pipelines organized by repository and workflow. Background refresh runs every X seconds (configurable per provider). When pipeline status changes, the UI updates automatically.\n\nMain capabilities:\n- View pipeline status across multiple providers\n- Browse run history with commit info and execution times\n- Trigger workflows with parameters dynamically loaded from each provider\n- Re-run previous executions with the same parameters\n- Cancel running builds\n- Multiple instances of the same provider type\n\nWhen triggering or re-running a workflow, the app fetches available parameters directly from the provider plugin (workflow inputs for GitHub Actions, pipeline variables for GitLab CI, build parameters for Jenkins and Buildkite, etc.) and displays them in a form.\n\n**Privacy First**\n\nEverything runs locally on the machine. The app only connects to configured CI/CD providers – no analytics, telemetry, or third-party services. Pipeline data is stored in a local SQLite database and API tokens are encrypted in the system keyring.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/hcavarsan/pipedash/releases).\n\nAvailable for macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n## Setup\n\nLaunch the app and add a provider via the sidebar. Each provider needs an API token:\n\n**GitHub Actions**: Personal Access Token with `repo` and `workflow` scopes. Optionally set a custom base URL for GitHub Enterprise.\n\n**GitLab CI**: Personal Access Token with `api` scope. Supports both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances.\n\n**Buildkite**: API Access Token with read permissions and the organization slug.\n\n**Jenkins**: API token, username, and server URL.\n\n**Tekton CD**: Kubernetes config file path and context. Automatically detects namespaces with Tekton pipelines.\n\nAfter adding a provider, the app validates credentials and fetches available repositories. Select which ones to monitor and save. Pipelines will appear in the main view and refresh automatically.\n\n## How It Works\n\n**Store**\n\nProvider configurations are stored in a local SQLite database. Tokens are kept separate in the system keyring.\n\nEach provider has its own refresh interval (default: 30 seconds), adjustable based on API rate limits.\n\n\n\n**Plugin System**\n\nEach CI/CD provider is implemented as a plugin that exposes a common interface. The core application doesn't know the specifics of how GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Buildkite, Jenkins, or Tekton work—it just calls standard methods like `fetch_pipelines()` or `trigger_pipeline()` and the plugin handles the details.\n\nPlugins are compiled into the application at build time, not loaded dynamically at runtime. This keeps things simpler and avoids the security concerns of runtime plugin loading.\n\nWhen the app starts, it loads cached pipeline data from SQLite immediately. In the background, a refresh loop polls each provider's API and updates the cache when changes are detected. The frontend listens for events and re-renders when new data arrives.\n\n## Adding Providers\n\nTo add support for a new CI/CD platform, create a new crate in `crates/pipedash-plugin-{name}/` and implement the `Plugin` trait from `pipedash-plugin-api`. The trait defines methods for fetching pipelines, validating credentials, triggering builds, and retrieving run history.\n\nEach plugin should follow this structure:\n- `schema.rs` - Table and column definitions speci",

We are working to make it production-ready, but do not use it for critical data until it is ready.\n\n## What is AgentFS?\n\nAgentFS is a filesystem designed specifically for AI agents. Just as traditional filesystems provide file and directory abstractions for applications, AgentFS provides the storage abstractions that AI agents need.\n\nAt the heart of AgentFS is the [agent filesystem](SPEC.md) - a complete SQLite-based storage system for agents implemented using [Turso](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso). It combines three essential components: a POSIX-like virtual filesystem for files and directories, a key-value store for agent state and context, and an audit trail tool for debugging and analysis. Everything an agent does - every file it creates, every piece of state it stores, every tool it invokes - lives in a single SQLite database file.\n\n## Components\n\nAgentFS provides four main components:\n\n* **[CLI](MANUAL.md)** - Command-line interface for managing agents\n* **SDK** - TypeScript and Rust libraries for programmatic access\n* **Sandbox** - Linux-compatible execution environment\n* **[Specification](SPEC.md)** - SQLite-based filesystem architecture\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Using the CLI\n\nInitialize an agent filesystem:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs init\nCreated agent filesystem: agent.db\n```\n\nRun a program in the sandbox with the agent filesystem mounted at `/agent`:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs run /bin/bash\nWelcome to AgentFS!\n\n$ echo \"hello from agent\" > /agent/hello.txt\n$ cat /agent/hello.txt\nhello from agent\n$ exit\n```\n\nInspect the agent filesystem from outside:\n\n```bash\n$ agentfs fs ls\nf hello.txt\n\n$ agentfs fs cat hello.txt\nhello from agent\n```\n\nRead the **[User Manual](MANUAL.md)** for complete documentation.\n\n### Using the SDK\n\nInstall the SDK in your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install agentfs-sdk\n```\n\nUse it in your agent code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { AgentFS } from 'agentfs-sdk';\n\nconst agent = new AgentFS('./agent.db');\n\n// Key-value operations\nawait agent.kv.set('user:preferences', { theme: 'dark' });\nconst prefs = await agent.kv.get('user:preferences');\n\n// Filesystem operations\nawait agent.fs.writeFile('/output/report.pdf', pdfBuffer);\nconst files = await agent.fs.readdir('/output');\n\n// Tool call tracking\nawait agent.tools.record(\n  'web_search',\n  Date.now() / 1000,\n  Date.now() / 1000 + 1.5,\n  { query: 'AI' },\n  { results: [...] }\n);\n```\n\nSee the **[SDK documentation in MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md#agentfs-sdk)** and **[examples](sdk/examples/)** for more details.\n\n## Why AgentFS?\n\n**Auditability**: Every file operation, tool call, and state change is recorded in SQLite. Query your agent's complete history with SQL to debug issues, analyze behavior, or meet compliance requirements.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Snapshot an agent's state at any point with `cp agent.db snapshot.db`. Restore it later to reproduce exact execution states, test what-if scenarios, or roll back mistakes.\n\n**Portability**: The entire agent runtime—files, state, history —is stored in a single SQLite file. Move it between machines, check it into version control, or deploy it to any system where Turso runs.\n\n**Simplicity**: No configuration files, no database servers, no distributed systems. Just a single file and a simple API.\n\n**Sandboxing**: Run agents in an isolated Linux environment where filesystem access is controlled and monitored. Perfect for testing untrusted code or enforcing security policies.\n\n## Learn More\n\n- **[User Manual](MANUAL.md)** - Complete guide to using the AgentFS CLI and SDK\n- **[Agent Filesystem Specification](SPEC.md)** - Technical specification of the SQLite schema\n- **[SDK Examples](sdk/examples/)** - Working code examples\n- **[Turso database](https://github.com/tursodatabase/turso)** - an in-process SQL database, compatible with SQLite.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Built with Ratatui.\n\n![Demo](src/screenshots/hustler-tracker-demo-new.gif)\n\n## What Does This Do?\n\n- **Tracks your app usage** - Automatically monitors which programs you're using\n- **Shows pretty charts** - See your time broken down by app and category\n- **Saves your data** - Everything stored locally in your own PostgreSQL database\n- **Works everywhere** - Linux, macOS, and Windows\n\n## Quick Start (Easiest Way)\n\n### Linux\n\nCopy and paste this into your terminal:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y make docker.io curl git openssl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y && source ~/.cargo/env && git clone https://github.com/adolfousier/neura-hustle-tracker.git && cd neura-hustle-tracker && make run\n```\n\nThat's it! The app will start tracking automatically.\n\n### macOS\n\n1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) first\n2. Then paste this into Terminal:\n\n```bash\nbrew install make git rustup-init && rustup-init -y && source ~/.cargo/env && git clone https://github.com/adolfousier/neura-hustle-tracker.git && cd neura-hustle-tracker && make daemon-start\n```\n\n3. View your stats anytime: `make view`\n\n### Windows\n\n1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)\n2. Open PowerShell as Administrator\n3. Run this:\n\n```powershell\npowershell -Command \"iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adolfousier/neura-hustle-tracker/main/src/scripts/windows_build/windows-install.ps1 | iex\"\n```\n\n4. View your stats anytime: `hustle-view`\n\n## Already Have Rust and Docker?\n\nIf you already have the prerequisites installed:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/adolfousier/neura-hustle-tracker\ncd neura-hustle-tracker\nmake run\n```\n\nDone! The app handles everything else automatically.\n\n## How to Use It\n\nOnce the app is running:\n\n- **Tab** - Switch between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views\n- **h** - See your complete session history\n- **r** - Rename apps to organize them better\n- **Shift+C** - See all available commands\n- **q** - Quit\n\nThe app tracks automatically. Just switch between your programs normally and it records everything.\n\n## Two Ways to Run (Important!)\n\n### Linux Users → Use \"Unified Mode\"\n\nRun `make run` and you're done. Everything works in one window.\n\n**Available commands for Linux:**\n\n- `make run` - Start DB + build + run app (all in one!)\n- `make dev` - Start DB + run in dev mode (faster builds)\n- `make db-up` - Start PostgreSQL in Docker\n- `make db-down` - Stop PostgreSQL\n- `make build` - Build TUI binary only\n- `make build-daemon` - Build daemon binary only\n- `make clean` - Clean all build artifacts and stop DB\n- `make help` - Show all available commands\n\n### macOS/Windows Users → Use \"Daemon Mode\"\n\nYou need two steps because of how these systems work:\n\n1. **Start tracking in background**: `make daemon-start`\n2. **Open the dashboard**: `make view`\n\nWhy? On macOS/Windows, if the tracking runs in the dashboard window, it can't see when you switch to other apps. Running it in the background fixes this.\n\n**Commands for daemon mode:**\n\n- `make daemon-start` - Start tracking\n- `make view` - Open dashboard\n- `make daemon-stop` - Stop tracking\n- `make daemon-status` - Check if running\n\n## What You Need\n\n- **Computer**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, or Linux with a desktop\n- **Space**: About 500MB for Docker and dependencies\n- **Permissions**:\n  - **macOS**: Terminal application needs the following permissions (daemon binary itself does NOT need permissions):\n    - Accessibility\n    - Screen & System Audio Settings\n    - Input Monitoring\n  - **Windows**: Works out of the box\n  - **Linux**: Needs a desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, etc.)\n\n  **Note**: On macOS/Windows, the daemon runs in the background without needing permissions. The **Terminal application** itself needs the permissions listed above to monitor your system properly.\n\n## Special Notes\n",

Especially useful when projects don't use Nix!\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"🌍 System-Wide Approach<br/>(NixOS/home-manager)\"] -->|Pro: Centralized<br/>Con: Loses project specificity| B[\"Management Challenge\"]\n    C[\"📁 Per-Project Approach<br/>(flake.nix/direnv)\"] -->|Pro: Project-specific<br/>Con: Setup burden| B\n    B -->|Envoluntary Solution| D[\"✨ Pattern-Based Centralized<br/>(Best of both worlds)\"]\n    D --> E[\"✅ Centralized config<br/>✅ Project-aware<br/>✅ No per-project setup<br/>✅ Works for non-Nix projects\"]\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- **Pattern-based matching**: Define directory patterns once in your config, get\n  automatic environment loading everywhere\n- **Flake-native**: Built for Nix flakes from the ground up\n- **Shell agnostic**: Works with bash, zsh, and fish\n- **Fast caching**: Profiles are cached and only rebuilt when needed\n- **Zero per-project setup**: No `.envrc` files to commit or maintain\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **Install**:\n\n   ```bash\n   cargo install envoluntary\n   ```\n\n   Or use via Nix shell\n\n   ```bash\n   nix shell github:dfrankland/envoluntary -c envoluntary --help\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the shell hook** to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `config.fish`:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Bash/Zsh\n   eval \"$(envoluntary shell hook bash)\"  # or zsh\n\n   # Fish\n   envoluntary shell hook fish | source\n   ```\n\n   Or use via Nix shell\n\n   ```bash\n   # Bash/Zsh\n   eval \"$(nix shell github:dfrankland/envoluntary -c envoluntary shell hook bash)\"  # or zsh\n\n   # Fish\n   nix shell github:dfrankland/envoluntary -c envoluntary shell hook fish | source\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure your environments** in `~/.config/envoluntary/config.toml`:\n\n   ```toml\n   [[entries]]\n   pattern = \".*/projects/my-website(/.*)?\"\n   flake_reference = \"~/nix-dev-shells/nodejs\"\n   # Set whether the flake is impure\n   impure = true\n\n   [[entries]]\n   # Patterns can match on tilde too\n   pattern = \"~/projects/rust-.*\"\n   flake_reference = \"github:NixOS/templates/30a6f18?dir=rust\"\n\n   # Adjacent files or directories can be used to narrow pattern matches\n   [[entries]]\n   pattern = \".*\"\n   pattern_adjacent = \".*/Cargo\\\\.toml\"\n   flake_reference = \"github:NixOS/templates/30a6f18?dir=rust\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Navigate** to a matching directory and your environment loads automatically!\n\n## Installing with Nix\n\nThe `envoluntary` flake exports a Nix overlay, making it easy to integrate into\nyour own Nix flake.\n\n### About the Flake\n\nThe `flake.nix` in this repository is a [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/)\nmodule that:\n\n- Exports the `envoluntary` package as its `defaultPackage`\n- Provides an overlay that makes `envoluntary` available in your own flakes\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Using the Overlay</strong></summary>\n\nTo use `envoluntary` in your own `flake.nix`, follow these steps:\n\n#### 1. Add the input\n\nAdd `envoluntary` to your flake inputs:\n\n```nix\n{\n  description = \"Your flake description\";\n\n  inputs = {\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n    envoluntary = {\n      url = \"github:dfrankland/envoluntary\";\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n    };\n  };\n\n  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, envoluntary }:\n    # ... rest of your flake\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Apply the overlay\n\nApply the overlay to your `pkgs`:\n\n```nix\noutputs = { self, nixpkgs, envoluntary }:\n  let\n    system = \"x86_64-linux\"; # or your system\n    pkgs = import nixpkgs {\n      inherit system;\n      overlays = [ envoluntary.overlays.default ];\n    };\n  in {\n    # Now pkgs.envoluntary is available\n  }\n```\n\n#### 3. Use in your environment\n\nYou can now use `envoluntary` in your development shell or system configuration:\n\n```nix\ndevShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {\n  buildInputs = [ pkgs.envoluntary ];\n};\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Using the home-manager Module</strong></summary>\n\nThe `envoluntary` flake exports a home-manager module for seamless integration\nwith your home configuration.\n\n> **Note:** The overlay must be applied to your `pkgs` for this module to work.\n> See the \"Using the Overlay\" section above.\n\n#### 1. Add the input\n\nAdd `envoluntary` to your flake inputs (if not already added):\n\n```nix\n{\n  description = \"Your flake description\";\n\n  inputs = {\n    nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-unstable\";\n    home-manager = {\n      url = \"github:nix-community/home-manager\";\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n    };\n    envoluntary = {\n      url = \"github:dfrankland/envoluntary\";\n      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\n      inputs.home-manager.follows = \"home-manager\";\n    };\n  };\n\n  ou",

This library is intentionally **over-commented**, not because the code is disorganized, but because it's designed to be a **teaching tool**. The goal is elegant, idiomatic Rust code that Rubyists can learn from without the usual compile-pray-repeat cycle.\n\n### Philosophy\n\n- **Learning Ground First**: Extensive inline comments explain Rust concepts, ownership, trait bounds, and macro magic\n- **Ruby Parallels**: Familiar DSL syntax and callbacks make the transition smoother\n- **Production Ready**: Despite the educational focus, this is a fully functional state machine library with:\n  - **Typestate pattern** for compile-time state safety\n  - **Zero-cost abstractions** using PhantomData\n  - Guards and unless conditions\n  - Before/after event callbacks\n  - Sync and async support\n  - `no_std` compatibility (for embedded systems)\n  - Payload support for event data\n  - Move semantics preventing invalid state transitions\n\n### For the Rust Community\n\n**You're welcome to open PRs** to fix fundamentally wrong Rust concepts—but please **don't remove comments just because \"we know it\"**. This codebase serves beginners. If something can be explained better, improve the comment. If a pattern is unidiomatic, fix it *and document why*.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n**Typestate Pattern** – Compile-time state safety using Rust's type system with zero runtime overhead\n\n**Guards & Unless** – Conditional transitions at event and transition levels\n\n**Callbacks** – `before`/`after` hooks at event level\n\n**Around Callbacks** – Wrap transitions with Before/AfterSuccess stages for transaction-like semantics\n\n**Async Support** – First-class `async`/`await` for guards and callbacks\n\n**Event Payloads** – Pass data through transitions with type-safe payloads\n\n**No-std Compatible** – Works on embedded targets (ESP32, bare metal)\n\n**Type-safe** – Invalid transitions become compile errors, not runtime errors\n\n**Hierarchical States** – Superstates with polymorphic transitions via SubstateOf trait\n\n**Dynamic Dispatch** – Runtime event dispatch for event-driven systems (opt-in via feature flag or explicit config)\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAdd to your `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nstate-machines = \"0.1\"\n```\n\n### Basic Example\n\n```rust\nuse state_machines::state_machine;\n\n// Define your state machine\nstate_machine! {\n    name: TrafficLight,\n\n    initial: Red,\n    states: [Red, Yellow, Green],\n    events {\n        next {\n            transition: { from: Red, to: Green }\n            transition: { from: Green, to: Yellow }\n            transition: { from: Yellow, to: Red }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Typestate pattern: each transition returns a new typed machine\n    let light = TrafficLight::new(());\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Red>\n\n    let light = light.next().unwrap();\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Green>\n\n    let light = light.next().unwrap();\n    // Type is TrafficLight<Yellow>\n}\n```\n\n### With Guards and Callbacks\n\n```rust\nuse state_machines::{state_machine, core::GuardError};\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\n\nstatic DOOR_OBSTRUCTED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);\n\nstate_machine! {\n    name: Door,\n\n    initial: Closed,\n    states: [Closed, Open],\n    events {\n        open {\n            guards: [path_clear],\n            before: [check_safety],\n            after: [log_opened],\n            transition: { from: Closed, to: Open }\n        }\n        close {\n            transition: { from: Open, to: Closed }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<C, S> Door<C, S> {\n    fn path_clear(&self, _ctx: &C) -> bool {\n        !DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.load(Ordering::Relaxed)\n    }\n\n    fn check_safety(&self) {\n        println!(\"Checking if path is clear...\");\n    }\n\n    fn log_opened(&self) {\n        println!(\"Door opened at {:?}\", std::time::SystemTime::now());\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Successful transition\n    let door = Door::new(());\n    let door = door.open().unwrap();\n    let door = door.close().unwrap();\n\n    // Failed guard check\n    DOOR_OBSTRUCTED.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);\n    let err = door.open().expect_err(\"should fail when obstructed\"",

      "readme": "# fairshare\n\n**Fair resource allocation for shared Linux systems**\n\nA lightweight resource manager that prevents any single user from monopolizing CPU and memory on multi-user Linux servers. fairshare automatically enforces per-user limits while allowing users to request additional resources dynamically when they need them.\n\n### The Problem fairshare Solves\n\nOn shared Linux systems, one user running a heavy workload can consume all available CPU and memory, leaving nothing for other users. This creates a terrible experience and reduces productivity.\n\n### The Solution\n\nfairshare allocates resources fairly across all users:\n- **Default**: Each user gets 1 CPU core and 2GB RAM by default\n- **Reserved**: System reserves resources for OS and background processes (2 CPUs, 4GB RAM by default)\n- **On-demand**: Users can request more resources when needed (up to 1000 CPU cores and 10000 GB RAM)\n- **Automatic**: The system grants requests only if resources are truly available\n- **Fair**: No user can monopolize the entire system\n\n## Installation\n\n### Quick Install (Recommended)\n\nThe easiest way to install fairshare is using the installation script:\n\n```bash\n# Download and run the installer\ncurl -sSL https://raw.github.com/WilliamJudge94/fairshare/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nOr if you prefer to inspect the script first:\n\n```bash\n# Download the installer\nwget https://raw.github.com/WilliamJudge94/fairshare/main/install.sh\n\n# Review it\ncat install.sh\n\n# Run it\nbash install.sh\n```\n\nThe installer will:\n- Detect if PolicyKit is installed (automatically installs it if missing)\n- Download the latest release binary for your architecture\n- Install the binary and wrapper script\n- Set up PolicyKit policies\n- Configure default resource limits (1 CPU core, 2GB RAM per user)\n- Set system reserves (2 CPUs, 4GB RAM by default)\n\n![Admin Setup](static/root-admin-setup.png)\n\n### Build from Source\n\nIf you prefer to build from source or are developing fairshare:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Build the release binary\ncargo build --release\n\n# 2. Run the installer (it will detect the local build and install PolicyKit if needed)\nbash install.sh\n```\n\nAlternatively, use the Makefile for manual installation:\n\n```bash\n# Build and install binary and wrapper\ncargo build --release\nsudo make release\n\n# Ensure PolicyKit is installed (required for fairshare to work)\n# Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install policykit-1\n\n# Fedora/RHEL\nsudo dnf install polkit\n\n# Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S polkit\n\n# Setup admin defaults and PolicyKit policies (REQUIRED)\nsudo fairshare admin setup --cpu 1 --mem 2\n```\n\n### What Gets Installed\n\n- **`/usr/local/bin/fairshare`** - Wrapper script (user-facing command)\n- **`/usr/local/libexec/fairshare-bin`** - Real binary (internal use only)\n- **PolicyKit policies** - Allow passwordless execution for active users\n- **Systemd configuration** - Default resource limits for all user slices\n\nThe wrapper script automatically detects whether you're running an admin command (requires `sudo`) or a regular user command (automatically uses `pkexec`).\n\n### Requirements\n- **Linux** with systemd (including user session support)\n- **PolicyKit (polkit)** for privilege escalation (automatically installed by the installer if missing)\n- **Rust 1.70+** (only needed for building from source)\n\n### Uninstall\n\nTo remove fairshare from your system:\n\n```bash\n# Using the uninstall script\ncurl -sSL https://raw.github.com/WilliamJudge94/fairshare/main/uninstall.sh | bash\n\n# Or if you have the repository\nbash uninstall.sh\n\n# Or manually\nsudo fairshare admin uninstall --force\n```\n\n## Usage Guide\n\n### User Commands (No sudo required)\n\nRegular users can manage their own resource allocations. The wrapper script automatically handles privilege escalation via PolicyKit, so you don't need to type `pkexec` or `sudo`.\n\n#### 1. Check System Status\nSee how much CPU and memory is available and what each user is currently using.\n```bash\nfairshare status\n```\n\n![User Status](static/user-status.png)\n\n#### 2. Check Your Current Allocation\nView how much CPU and memory your user session has access to.\n```bash\nfairshare info\n```\n\n#### 3. Request Resources\nAsk for CPU and memory resources. The system uses **smart delta-based checking** - it only needs enough free resources to cover the increase from your current allocation.\n\n```bash\nfairshare request --cpu 4 --mem 8\n```\n\n![User Request](static/user-request.png)\n\n**Smart Allocation Example:**\n- You currently have: 9GB RAM allocated\n- System has: 2GB free\n- You request: 10GB RAM\n- Result: **SUCCESS** (net increase is only 1GB, which fits in the 2GB available)\n\n**Constraints:**\n- CPU: 1–1000 cores\n- Memory: 1–10000 GB\n\n#### 4. Release Resources\nReturn your resources to the system and revert to the default allocation (1 CPU core, 2GB RAM).\n```bash\nfairshare release\n```\n\n![User Release](static/user-release.png)\n\n### Administrator Commands (Requires sudo)\n\n> **Note:** Admin commands must be run with `sudo`\n\n#### Set Default Limits and System Reserves\nConfigure",

PhantomTask leverages the Windows Task Scheduler API to create tasks that run in specific user sessions with elevated privileges.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Session Management**: Create tasks targeting specific Windows Terminal Services sessions\n- **Session Enumeration**: List all active sessions on the local machine with detailed information\n- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for both interactive token and password-based authentication\n- **Elevated Privileges**: Tasks can be configured to run with highest privileges\n- **Immediate Execution**: Automatically triggers tasks after creation with configurable session targeting\n- **Hidden Tasks**: Tasks are created as hidden by default\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Windows operating system\n- Rust toolchain (2024 edition)\n- Administrator privileges (recommended for full functionality)\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository and build using Cargo:\n\n```powershell\ngit clone <repository-url>\ncd phantomtask\ncargo build --release\n```\n\nThe compiled binary will be available at `target/release/phantomtask.exe`\n\n## Usage\n\n### Help\n\n```powershell\nUsage: phantomtask.exe [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -l, --list                   List active sessions on the local machine\n  -n, --name <taskname>        The name of the task to create\n  -f, --program <program>      The program to execute\n  -a, --arguments <arguments>  The arguments to pass to the program\n  -u, --username <username>    The username to run the task as\n  -p, --password <password>    The password for the specified username\n  -s, --sessionid <sessionid>  The session ID to run the task in\n  -h, --help                   Print help\n  -V, --version                Print version\n```\n\n### List Active Sessions\n\nDisplay all active Windows Terminal Services sessions with their details:\n\n```powershell\nphantomtask.exe --list\n# or\nphantomtask.exe -l\n```\n\nOutput example:\n\n```\n===== Active Sessions =====\n\nSessionID  User                 State           Station              Domain              \n=====================================================================================\n0          <None>               Active          Services             <Local>            \n1          Administrator        Active          Console              WORKSTATION        \n```\n\n### Create and Execute a Task\n\n**If you want to execute a task as `SYSTEM` (session 0), change the username in `get_user_from_session()`!** It is localisation dependent (Système, System, ...), and there is no automatic resolution on this account.\n\nCreate a scheduled task that runs in a specific session:\n\n```powershell\nphantomtask.exe --name \"MyTask\" --program \"C:\\path\\to\\program.exe\" --sessionid 1\n```\n\n#### Required Arguments\n\n- `-n, --name <TASKNAME>`: Name of the task to create\n- `-f, --program <PROGRAM>`: The program to execute\n- `-s, --sessionid <SESSIONID>`: Session ID where the task should run\n\n#### Optional Arguments\n\n- `-a, --arguments <ARGUMENTS>`: Arguments to pass to the program\n- `-u, --username <USERNAME>`: Username to run the task as\n- `-p, --password <PASSWORD>`: Password for the specified username\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Basic Task Creation\n\n```powershell\nphantomtask.exe -n \"NotepadTask\" -f \"notepad.exe\" -s 1\n```\n\n#### Task with Arguments\n\n```powershell\nphantomtask.exe -n \"CmdTask\" -f \"cmd.exe\" -a \"/c dir\" -s 1\n```\n\n#### Task with Specific User Credentials\n\n```powershell\nphantomtask.exe -n \"UserTask\" -f \"C:\\Tools\\app.exe\" -u \"DOMAIN\\User\" -p \"Password123\" -s 1\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **COM Initialization**: Initializes the Component Object Model (COM) library with multithreaded apartment\n2. **Task Scheduler Connection**: Connects to the Windows Task Scheduler service\n3. **Task Definition**: Creates a new task definition with:\n   - Time trigger (scheduled to run 1 minute after creation)\n   - Execution action with specified program and arguments\n   - Principal configuration (user and logon type)\n   - Security settings (run with highest privileges)\n4. **Session Resolution**: Resolves the username associated with the target session ID\n5. **Task Registration**: Registers the task in the root folder of Task Scheduler\n6. **Immediate Execution**: Triggers the task immediately using the resolved session context\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nphantomtask/\n├── Cargo.toml          # Project dependencies and configuration\n├── src/\n│   ├── main.rs         # Entry point and CLI argument parsing\n│   ├── tasks.rs        # Task creation and registration logic\n│   ├── sessions.rs     # Session enumeration and user resolution\n│   └── utils.rs        # Utility functions (wide string conversion)\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **windows**: Windows API bindings for Rust (v0.62.2)\n  - Task Scheduler COM interfaces\n  - Remote Desktop Services API\n  - COM and OLE support\n- **windows-core**: Core Windows types (v0.62.2)\n- **clap**: Command-line argument parser (v4.5.51)\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Windows-o",

      "readme": "# Rust Raytracer\n\n> A high-performance path tracing renderer with CPU, GPU, and real-time interactive implementations\n\n![Example Render](doc/bunny_rotated.png)\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n**Try it online:** [Live WebGPU Raytracer](https://tchauffi.github.io/rust-rasterizer/)\n\n**Run locally:**\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tchauffi/rust-rasterizer.git\ncd rust-rasterizer\ncargo run --bin live_raytracer --release\n```\n\nUse your mouse to rotate the camera and press `SPACE` to toggle rendering modes!\n\n## ✨ What is this?\n\nThis project demonstrates three different approaches to ray tracing - a rendering technique that simulates how light behaves in the real world to create photorealistic images:\n\n1. **🖥️ CPU Raytracer** - Traditional software rendering with full path tracing\n2. **⚡ GPU Raytracer** - Hardware-accelerated offline rendering using compute shaders\n3. **🎮 Live GPU Raytracer** - Real-time interactive raytracer you can navigate and explore\n\nWhether you're learning about ray tracing, exploring Rust graphics programming, or looking for a starting point for your own renderer, this project provides working examples of multiple rendering approaches.\n\n## 🎯 Key Features\n\n- **Multiple Rendering Backends**: Choose between CPU, offline GPU, or real-time GPU rendering\n- **Path Tracing**: Physically-based lighting with multiple light bounces for realistic illumination\n- **Mesh Support**: Load and render complex .obj models with triangle meshes\n- **HDR Environment Maps**: Support for high dynamic range .exr skyboxes\n- **Interactive Controls**: Real-time camera navigation with mouse controls\n- **WebAssembly Support**: Runs in the browser using WebGPU\n- **Multiple Materials**: Diffuse, metallic surface properties\n- **Acceleration Structures**: BVH for efficient ray-mesh intersection\n- **Progressive Rendering**: Denoising and sample accumulation for high-quality images\n\n## 📦 Installation & Usage\n\n### 🖥️ CPU Raytracer (Software Rendering)\n\nThe CPU version renders scenes using traditional CPU-based raytracing and outputs to a PPM image file. Best for learning how raytracing works under the hood.\n\n```bash\n# Build and run (outputs to stdout, redirect to file)\ncargo run --release > output.ppm\n\n# Or build first, then run\ncargo build --release\n./target/release/rust-raytracer > output.ppm\n```\n\n**Use this when:**\n\n- Learning raytracing fundamentals\n- Debugging rendering algorithms\n- No GPU compute support available\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Full path tracing with multiple bounces\n- Direct and indirect lighting\n- Mesh support (.obj files)\n- Sphere primitives\n\n### ⚡ GPU Raytracer (Offline Rendering)\n\nThe GPU version uses compute shaders to accelerate rendering, outputting to a PPM file. Significantly faster than CPU rendering for high-quality images.\n\n```bash\n# Build and run\ncargo run --bin gpu_raytracer --release > output.ppm\n\n# Or build separately\ncargo build --bin gpu_raytracer --release\n./target/release/gpu_raytracer > output.ppm\n```\n\n**Use this when:**\n\n- Rendering high-quality final images\n- Need faster rendering than CPU\n- Don't need real-time interaction\n\n**Features:**\n\n- GPU-accelerated compute shader rendering\n- Same scene quality as CPU version\n- Significantly faster rendering times (10-100x speedup)\n- Hardware-accelerated ray-triangle intersection\n\n### 🎮 Live GPU Raytracer (Interactive Real-time)\n\nThe live version provides a real-time interactive window where you can navigate the scene. Perfect for exploring scenes and iterating on designs.\n\n```bash\n# Run the live raytracer\ncargo run --bin live_raytracer --release\n```\n\n**Use this when:**\n\n- Exploring and navigating scenes interactively\n- Setting up camera angles for final renders\n- Demonstrating raytracing in real-time\n- Debugging scene geometry\n\n**Controls:**\n\n- **Mouse**: Click and drag to rotate the camera\n- **SPACE**: Toggle between raytracing and normals visualization modes\n- **Window Title**: Displays current mode and FPS\n\n**Features:**\n\n- Real-time GPU raytracing (30-60 FPS on modern GPUs)\n- Interactive camera controls\n- Two rendering modes:\n  - **Raytracing**: Full path tracing with lighting and shadows\n  - **Normals**: Fast visualization showing surface normals (useful for debugging)\n- Live FPS counter in window title\n- WebAssembly support for browser-based rendering\n\n## 🛠️ Requirements\n\n- **Rust**: Latest stable version (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))\n- **GPU versions**: A GPU with compute shader support\n  - Vulkan (Linux, Windows, Android)\n  - Metal (macOS, iOS)\n  - DirectX 12 (Windows)\n- **Web version**: A browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Firefox with flag)\n\n## 🌐 Web Deployment\n\nThe project can be built for WebAssembly and deployed to GitHub Pages:\n\n```bash\n# Install trunk (if not already installed)\ncargo install trunk\n\n# Build for web\ntrunk build --release\n\n# The output will be in the dist/ directory\n```\n\n## ⚙️ Performance\n\nPerformance varies based on hardware and scene complexity:\n\n| Renderer | Resolution | FPS/Time | Notes |\n|------",

      "readme": "# wayscriber\n\n> TL;DR: wayscriber is a ZoomIt-like screen annotation tool for Wayland compositors, written in Rust.\n> Works on compositors with the wlr-layer-shell protocol (Hyprland, Sway, river, …); building from source requires Rust 1.85+.\n> Quick start: [set it up in four steps](#quick-start).\n\n<details>\n<summary>📹 Demo Video (Click to expand)</summary>\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c4b36ec-0f6a-4aad-93fb-f9c966d43873\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>🖼️ Demo GIF (Click to expand)</summary>\n\n![Demo GIF](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e99eb161-c603-4133-926b-79de7a8fb567)\n\n</details>\n\n![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)\n![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-1.85%2B-orange.svg)\n\n- [Why wayscriber?](#why-wayscriber)\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Features at a Glance](#features-at-a-glance)\n- [Demo](#demo)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Running wayscriber](#running-wayscriber)\n- [Controls Reference](#controls-reference)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Additional Information](#additional-information)\n- [Project History](#project-history)\n- [Contributing & Credits](#contributing--credits)\n\n## Why wayscriber?\n\n- Works across Wayland compositors (Sway, Wayfire, River, Hyprland, …) via wlr-layer-shell. Tested extensively on Hyprland and confirmed working on Niri; reports from other compositors welcome.\n- Built for live presentations, classroom sessions, and screenshares - toggle with a key and annotate your screen instantly without breaking flow.\n- Complements tools like [Satty](https://github.com/gabm/Satty): Satty excels at capture → annotate → save workflows, while wayscriber stays resident as an always-available drawing layer with instant mode switching.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n**1. Install wayscriber**\n1. Arch Linux (AUR):  (build from source)\n\t- `yay -S wayscriber` \n\t- `paru -S wayscriber` \n2. Arch Linux (AUR, prebuilt): \n\t- `yay -S wayscriber-bin` \n\t- `paru -S wayscriber-bin`.\n3. Other distros: see [Installation](#installation), then install `wl-clipboard`, `grim`, and `slurp` for the fastest screenshot workflow.\n\n**2. Choose how to run it:**\n\n### Option 1: One-Shot Mode (Simple)\nLaunch wayscriber when you need it, exit when done:\n\n```bash\nwayscriber --active\n```\n\nOr bind to a key in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:\n```conf\nbind = SUPER, D, exec, wayscriber --active\n```\n\nPress `F10` for help, `F11` for configurator, `Escape`/`Ctrl+Q` to exit, and `F12` to toggle the status bar.\n\n### Option 2: Daemon Mode (Background Service)\nRun wayscriber in the background and toggle it with a keybind:\n\n**Enable the service:**\n```bash\nsystemctl --user enable --now wayscriber.service\n```\n\n**Add keybinding** to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:\n```conf\nbind = SUPER, D, exec, pkill -SIGUSR1 wayscriber\n```\n\n**Reload Hyprland:**\n```bash\nhyprctl reload\n```\n\n**Note:** If the daemon doesn't start after a reboot, see [Troubleshooting](#daemon-not-starting-after-reboot).\n\n**Alternative:** Use Hyprland's exec-once instead of systemd:\n```conf\nexec-once = wayscriber --daemon\nbind = SUPER, D, exec, pkill -SIGUSR1 wayscriber\n```\n\n## Features at a Glance\n\n- **Drawing & editing**: Freehand pen, straight lines, rectangles, ellipses, arrows, and multiline text with smoothing; undo & redo; quick line-width and color changes via hotkeys or scroll.\n- **Board modes**: Whiteboard, blackboard, and transparent overlays, each with isolated frames and auto pen contrast; snap back to transparent with `Ctrl+Shift+T`.\n- **Capture shortcuts**: Full-screen saves, active-window grabs, and region capture to file or clipboard using `grim`, `slurp`, and `wl-clipboard` when available.\n- **Session persistence**: Opt-in per board/monitor storage that restores your canvas plus pen color & thickness; inspect with `wayscriber --session-info` or clear with `wayscriber --clear-session`.\n- **Workflow helpers**: Background daemon with SIGUSR1 toggle, tray icon, one-shot mode, live status bar, and in-app help overlay (`F10`).\n- **Click highlights**: Presenter-style halo on mouse clicks with configurable colors, radius, and duration; follows your pen color by default, toggle the effect with `Ctrl+Shift+H` or swap to highlight-only mode with `Ctrl+Alt+H`.\n- **Configurator & CLI**: Launch `wayscriber-configurator` (or press `F11`) to tweak colors, bindings, persistence, compression, and more; power users can edit the TOML or use CLI switches.\n- **Performance & reliability**: Dirty-region rendering keeps redraws fast, while session files use atomic writes, size limits, compression, and backups for safety.\n\n### Session Persistence\n\nWayscriber can remember your boards between runs (per monitor and per board color) along with pen color/thickness. Persistence is opt-in. Toggle it from the configurator (`F11 → Session` tab) or launch the GUI directly:\n\n```bash\nwayscriber-configurator\n```\n\nPrefer text? Edit `~/.config/wayscriber/config.toml`. Helpful commands:\n\n```bash\nwayscriber --se",
