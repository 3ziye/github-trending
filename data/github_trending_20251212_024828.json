This allows logic to be tested on a host machine (e.g.,\nx86) before running on bare metal.\n\n* Address Types: Strong typing for `VA` (Virtual), `PA` (Physical), and `UA`\n  (User) addresses.\n* Containers: `VMA` management, generic page-based ring buffer (`kbuf`), and\n  waker sets.\n* Sync Primitives: `spinlock`, `mutex`, `condvar`, `per_cpu`.\n* Test Suite: A comprehensive suite of 230+ tests ensuring functionality across\n  architectures (e.g., validating Aarch64 page table parsing logic on an x86\n  host).\n\n## Building and Running\n\n### Prerequisites\nYou will need QEMU for aarch64 emulation, dosfstools and mtools to create the\nvirtual file system.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install qemu-system-aarch64 dosfstools mtools\n```\n\nAdditionally you will need a version of the [aarch64-none-elf](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain) toolchain installed.\n\n#### Any X86-64 Linux OS\nTo install aarch64-none-elf on any os, download the correct release of `aarch64-none-elf` onto your computer, unpack it, then export the `bin` folder to path (Can be done via running\n\n`export PATH=\"~/Downloads/arm-gnu-toolchain-X.X.relX-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf/bin:$PATH\"`, X is the version number you downloaded onto your machine.\n\nin your terminal.)\n\n#### macOS\nThere is experimental support for macOS in the scripts/mac-experimental folder. The scripts in there are not guaranteed to work for all macOS users and has only been tested on an M4 Apple Silicon MacBook Air.\n\n#### NixOS\n\nRun the following command\n\n```bash\nnix shell nixpkgs#pkgsCross.aarch64-embedded.stdenv.cc nixpkgs#pkgsCross.aarch64-embedded.stdenv.cc.bintools\n```\n\n### Preparing the image\n\nFirst, run the following script to prepare the binaries for the image:\n```bash\n./scripts/build-deps.sh\n```\n\nThis will download and build the necessary dependencies for the kernel and put them\ninto the `build` directory.\n\nOnce that is done, you can create the image using the following command:\n```bash\n./scripts/create-image.sh\n```\n\nThis will create an image file named `moss.img` in the root directory of the\nproject, format it as VFAT 32 and create the necessary files and directories for\nthe kernel.\n\n### Running via QEMU\n\nTo build the kernel and launch it in QEMU:\n\n``` bash\ncargo run --release\n```\n\n\n### Running the Test Suite\nBecause `libkernel` is architecturally decoupled, you can run the logic tests on\nyour host machine:\n\n``` bash\ncargo test -p libkernel --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n```\n\n\n### Roadmap & Status\n\nmoss is under active development. Current focus areas include:\n\n* Basic Linux Syscall Compatibility (Testing through BusyBox).\n* Networking Stack: TCP/IP implementation.\n* Scheduler Improvements: Task load balancing.\n* A fully read/write capable filesystem driver (e.g., ext2/4).\n* Expanding coverage beyond the current 49 calls.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Whether you are interested in writing a driver,\nporting to x86, or adding syscalls.\n\n## Licens",

It serves as a free and open alternative to the proprietary **Miele Diagnostic Utility (MDU)** software, which is only available to registered service technicians.\n\nMost Miele devices manufactured after 1996 include an optical infrared-based diagnostic interface, hidden behind one of the indicator lights on the front panel. On older appliances, this interface is marked by a **Program Correction (PC)** label.\n\nUntil now, communication with this interface required an expensive infrared adapter sold exclusively by Miele, along with their closed-source software. The goal of FreeMDU is to make this interface accessible to everyone for diagnostic and home automation purposes.\n\nThe project is split into three main components:\n\n- [**Protocol**](protocol): core protocol library and device implementations\n- [**TUI**](tui): terminal-based device diagnostic and testing tool\n- [**Home**](home): communication adapter firmware with MQTT integration for Home Assistant\n\nMore details about the proprietary diagnostic interface and the reverse-engineering process behind this project can be found in this [**blog post**](https://medusalix.github.io/posts/miele-interface).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This project is highly experimental and can cause permanent damage to your Miele devices if not used responsibly. Proceed at your own risk.\n\n## Supported devices\n\nWhen a connection is established via the diagnostic interface, the appliance responds with its **software ID**, a 16-bit number that uniquely identifies the firmware version running on the device's microcontroller. However, this ID does not directly correspond to a specific model or board type, so it's impossible to provide a comprehensive list of supported models.\n\nThe following table lists the software IDs and device/board combinations that have been confirmed to work with FreeMDU:\n\n| Software ID | Device         | Board      | Microcontroller           | Optical interface location   | Status             |\n|-------------|----------------|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 360         | Bare board     | EDPW 223-A | Mitsubishi M38078MC-065FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 419         | Bare board     | EDPW 206   | Mitsubishi M37451MC-804FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 605         | G 651 I PLUS-3 | EGPL 542-C | Mitsubishi M38027M8       | *Salt (PC)* indicator        | 🟢 Fully supported |\n| 629         | W 2446         | EDPL 126-B | Mitsubishi M38079MF-308FP | *Check inlet (PC)* indicator | 🟢 Fully supported |\n\nIf your appliance is not listed here but has a model number similar to one of the above, it might already be compatible. In all other cases, determining the **software ID** is the first step toward adding support for new devices.\n\nDetails for adding support for new devices will be provided soon.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore using any FreeMDU components, make sure you have the [Rust toolchain](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.\n\nNext, you'll need to build a [communication adapter](home/README.md#getting-started) to interface with your Miele device. Once the adapter is ready, choose the appropriate use case from the options below:\n\n### Device diagnostics and testing\n\nIf you want to repair or test your appliance:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **bridge mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n2. Run the [TUI](tui) application on your desktop computer.\n\n### Integration into home automation systems\n\nIf you want to integrate your appliance into **Home Assistant** or another home automation system:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **standalone mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n### Building custom tools\n\nIf you want to develop your own software to communicate with Miele devices:\n\n1. Flash the [home](home) firmware in **bridge mode** onto your communication adapter and attach it to your device.\n\n2. Use the [protocol](protocol) crate to implement your custom software.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis is an independent, open-source project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Miele & Cie.

Written in native Rust, it intelligently combines **OverlayFS** and **Magic Mount** technologies to provide a more efficient, stable, and stealthy module management experience compared to traditional mounting solutions.\n\nThis project includes a modern WebUI management interface built with Svelte, allowing users to monitor status, manage module modes, and view logs in real-time.\n\n**[ 🇨🇳 中文 (Chinese) ](README_ZH.md)**\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Core Features\n\n### 🚀 True Hybrid Engine\n* **Smart Strategy**: Prioritizes **OverlayFS** to achieve optimal I/O performance and filesystem merging capabilities.\n* **Automatic Fallback**: Automatically and seamlessly falls back to the **Magic Mount** mechanism when OverlayFS mounting fails, the target is unsupported, or when forcibly specified by the user.\n* **Rust Native**: The core daemon is written in Rust, utilizing `rustix` for direct system calls, ensuring safety and high efficiency.\n\n### 🔄 Smart Sync\n* **Fast Boot**: Abandons the inefficient pattern of full copying on every boot. The daemon compares `module.prop` checksums and only synchronizes new or modified modules.\n* **I/O Optimization**: Drastically reduces disk I/O usage during boot, significantly improving system startup speed.\n\n### 💾 Smart Storage\n* **Tmpfs Priority**: Defaults to attempting to use **Tmpfs** (memory-based filesystem) as the storage backend. It offers extremely fast read/write speeds and is cleared on reboot, providing high stealth.\n* **Automatic Image Fallback**: Automatically detects if the environment supports XATTR (required for SELinux). If Tmpfs does not support it, the system automatically creates and mounts a 2GB `ext4` loop image (`modules.img`) and includes capability for automatic image repair.\n\n### 🐾 Stealth Mode (Paw Pad / Nuke)\n* **Sysfs Cleanup**: Supports removing KernelSU traces in Sysfs via `ioctl` operations to enhance the stealth of the Root environment.\n\n### 📱 Modern WebUI\n* Built-in management panel based on Svelte + Vite.\n* Supports Dark/Light theme switching and multiple languages (Chinese, English, Japanese, Russian, Spanish).\n* Real-time monitoring of storage usage, mount status, and system logs.\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Architecture\n\nThe workflow of Meta-Hybrid Mount is as follows:\n\n1.  **Environment Init**: Initialize logging and camouflage the process name as `kworker`.\n2.  **Storage Prep**: Attempt to mount Tmpfs; if it fails or lacks extended attribute support, mount/repair `modules.img`.\n3.  **Inventory Scan**: Scan the module directory and read module configurations and modes (Auto/Magic).\n4.  **Incremental Sync**: Synchronize changed module files to the runtime storage directory.\n5.  **Mount Planning**:\n    * Generate the OverlayFS hierarchy (Lowerdirs).\n    * Identify paths requiring Magic Mount.\n6.  **Execution**: Execute mount operations according to the plan. If an Overlay fails, the module is automatically added to the Magic Mount queue for retry.\n7.  **State Save**: Save runtime state for the WebUI to read.\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration\n\nThe configuration file is located at `/data/adb/meta-hybrid/config.toml`. You can also modify it visually via the WebUI.\n\n| Option | Type | Default | Description |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `moduledir` | String | `/data/adb/modules/` | Path to the module source directory. |\n| `tempdir` | String | (Auto) | Temporary working directory. Automatically selected if left empty. |\n| `mountsource` | String | `KSU` | Mount source name, used for the `source` parameter in OverlayFS. |\n| `verbose` | Bool | `false` | Whether to enable detailed debug logging. |\n| `partitions` | Array | `[]` | List of extra partitions to mount (besides built-in ones like system/vendor). |\n| `force_ext4` | Bool | `false` | Force usage of `modules.img` without attempting Tmpfs. |\n| `enable_nuke` | Bool | `false` | Enable \"Paw Pad\" mode (Clean up Sysfs traces). |\n| `disable_umount` | Bool | `false` | Disable add_try_umount |\n\n---\n\n## 🖥️ WebUI Features\n\nAfter installing the module, you can access the WebUI via the KernelSU manager (or by opening the corresponding address in a browser).\n\n* **Status**:\n    * View storage usage of `modules.img` or Tmpfs.\n    * View Kernel version, SELinux status, and active mount partitions.\n    * Statistics for OverlayFS vs Magic Mount modules.\n* **Config**:\n    * Visual editor for `config.toml`.\n    * One-click configuration reload.\n* **Modules**:\n    * Search and filter installed modules.\n    * **Mode Switching**: Forcibly specify \"OverlayFS\" or \"Magic Mount\" mode for specific modules (useful for resolving bootloops caused by specific modules).\n* **Logs**:\n    * Real-time vi",

      "readme": "# proxychains-rs (v5.0.0)\n\nThis document is a concise usage and build guide for the proxychains-rs repository (version 5.0.0). It focuses on building, running and debugging the Rust implementation that provides proxychains-compatible behavior, and also covers common issues.\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nproxychains-rs (v5.0.0) is a Rust implementation that aims to be compatible with existing proxychains behavior. Its goal is to produce a shared library that can be injected into target programs using LD_PRELOAD and that behaves (including textual output) consistently with prior implementations. The runtime artifact produced by this project is `libproxychains_rs.so`.\n\nMain runtime artifact (release):\n\n- `target/release/libproxychains_rs.so` — the shared object produced by Rust (cdylib).\n\nNote: The supported runtime artifact is `target/release/libproxychains_rs.so`. The project does not rely on producing a compatibility copy named `libproxychains4.so` by default anymore.\n\nTip: this repository contains a `rust-toolchain` pin (nightly). Cargo will automatically use the pinned nightly toolchain when building the project.\n\nImportant: the repository uses some Rust nightly-only features in parts of the codebase (for example `c_variadic` / `extern_types`). Because of this, a nightly toolchain is required to build.\n\n---\n\n## Local build (recommended)\n\n1. Ensure you have rustup installed and enable the nightly toolchain:\n\n```bash\nrustup toolchain install nightly\n```\n\n2. Build the project using cargo from the `proxychains-rs` directory:\n\n```bash\n# Build the Rust portion using the nightly toolchain\nrustup run nightly cargo build -p proxychains_rs --release\n```\n\nThis will produce the shared object under `target/release/libproxychains_rs.so`.\n\n---\n\n## Using with a target program (example)\n\nTo use proxychains-rs with any dynamically linked program that supports LD_PRELOAD, set the configuration file path and LD_PRELOAD the built shared object:\n\n```bash\nPROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE=/etc/proxychains.conf LD_PRELOAD=target/release/libproxychains_rs.so curl -I https://www.baidu.com\n```\n\nIf you are replacing an existing `proxychains4` script or binary (the C-based tool), the Rust version aims to be consistent in behavior and log text. Using `target/release/libproxychains_rs.so` as LD_PRELOAD should act as a drop-in replacement for the C artifact.\n\nAn example wrapper similar to `/usr/bin/proxychains`:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"ProxyChains-5.0\"\nif [ $# = 0 ]; then\n    echo \"\\tusage:\"\n    echo \"\\t\\tproxychains <prog> [args]\"\n    exit\nfi\nexport LD_PRELOAD=libproxychains_rs.so\nexec \"$@\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuration and debugging options\n\n- Configuration file search order (priority):\n  1. `PROXYCHAINS_CONF_FILE` environment variable (or `-f` argument)\n  2. `./proxychains.conf` in the current directory\n  3. `$(HOME)/.proxychains/proxychains.conf`\n  4. System config `/etc/proxychains.conf` (sysconfdir)\n\n- Settings in the configuration file:\n  - `quiet_mode` — suppresses the per-connection log lines (same as the C implementation).\n  - `proxy_dns`, `proxy_dns_daemon`, `proxy_dns_old` — control remote-DNS (RDNS) behavior/modes.\n\n- Environment variables:\n  - `PROXYCHAINS_VERBOSE_DEBUG=1` — enable extra internal debug traces for development and troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Q: Why is a nightly toolchain required to build?\n  - A: The port uses Rust features that are currently only available on the nightly channel (for example `c_variadic` / `extern_types`). That's why the nightly toolchain is required.\n\n---\n\n## Future improvements (suggestions)\n\n- Reduce or remove `unsafe` and `static mut` usage where practical and refactor key paths to be more idiomatic Rust (long-term goal).\n- Improve cross-platform support.\n\n---\n\n",

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, Pi-Agent; each creates a trail of conversations, debugging sessions, and problem-solving attempts. But this wealth of knowledge is **scattered and unsearchable**:\n\n- **Fragmented storage**: Each agent stores data differently—JSONL files, SQLite databases, markdown logs, proprietary JSON formats\n- **No cross-agent visibility**: Solutions discovered in Cursor are invisible when you're using Claude Code\n- **Lost context**: That brilliant debugging session from two weeks ago? Good luck finding it by scrolling through files\n- **No semantic search**: File-based grep doesn't understand code structure or natural language queries\n\n### The Solution\n\n`cass` treats your coding agent history as a **unified knowledge base**. It:\n\n1. **Normalizes** disparate formats into a common schema\n2. **Indexes** everything with a purpose-built full-text search engine\n3. **Surfaces** relevant past conversations in milliseconds\n4. **Respects** your privacy—everything stays local, nothing phones home\n\n### Who Benefits\n\n- **Individual developers**: Find that solution you know you've seen before\n- **Teams**: Share institutional knowledge across different tool preferences\n- **AI agents themselves**: Let your current agent learn from all your past agents (via robot mode)\n- **Power users**: Build workflows that leverage your complete coding history\n\n---\n\n## ✨ Key Features\n\n### ⚡ Instant Search (Sub-60ms Latency)\n- **\"Search-as-you-type\"**: Results update instantly with every keystroke.\n- **Edge N-Gram Indexing**: We frontload the work by pre-computing prefix matches (e.g., \"cal\" -> \"calculate\") during indexing, trading disk space for O(1) lookup speed at query time.\n- **Smart Tokenization**: Handles `snake_case` (\"my_var\" matches \"my\" and \"var\"), hyphenated terms, and code symbols (`c++`, `foo.bar`) correctly.\n- **Zero-Stall Updates**: The background indexer commits changes atomically; `reader.reload()` ensures new messages appear in the search bar immediately without restarting.\n\n### 🎯 Advanced Search Features\n- **Wildcard Patterns**: Full glob-style pattern support:\n  - `foo*` - Prefix match (finds \"foobar\", \"foo123\")\n  - `*foo` - Suffix match (finds \"barfoo\", \"configfoo\")\n  - `*foo*` - Substring match (finds \"afoob\", \"configuration\")\n- **Auto-Fuzzy Fallback**: When exact searches return sparse results, automatically retries with `*term*` wildcards to broaden matches. Visual indicator shows when fallback is active.\n- **Query History Deduplication**: Recent searches deduplicated to show unique queries; navigate with `Up`/`Down` arrows.\n- **Match Quality Ranking**: New ranking mode (cycle with `F12`) that prioritizes exact matches over wildcard/fuzzy results.\n- **Match Highlighting**: Use `--highlight` in robot mode to wrap matching terms with markers (`**bold**` for text, `<mark>` for HTML output).\n\n### 🖥️ Rich Terminal UI (TUI)\n- **Three-Pane Layout**: Filter bar (top), scrollable results (left), and syntax-highlighted details (right).\n- **Multi-Line Result Display**: Each result shows location and up to 3 lines of context; alt",

No additional packages needed.\n\n## What Problem Does RuVector Solve?\n\nTraditional vector databases just store and search. When you ask \"find similar items,\" they return results but never get smarter. They don't scale horizontally. They can't route AI requests intelligently.\n\n**RuVector is different:**\n\n1. **Store vectors** like any vector DB (embeddings from OpenAI, Cohere, etc.)\n2. **Query with Cypher** like Neo4j (`MATCH (a)-[:SIMILAR]->(b) RETURN b`)\n3. **The index learns** — GNN layers make search results improve over time\n4. **Scale horizontally** — Raft consensus, multi-master replication, auto-sharding\n5. **Route AI requests** — Semantic routing and FastGRNN neural inference for LLM optimization\n6. **Compress automatically** — 2-32x memory reduction with adaptive tiered compression\n7. **39 attention mechanisms** — Flash, linear, graph, hyperbolic for custom models\n8. **Drop into Postgres** — pgvector-compatible extension with SIMD acceleration\n9. **Run anywhere** — Node.js, browser (WASM), HTTP server, or native Rust\n10. **Continuous learning** — SONA enables runtime adaptation with LoRA, EWC++, and ReasoningBank\n\nThink of it as: **Pinecone + Neo4j + PyTorch + postgres + etcd** in one Rust package.\n\n\n\n## How the GNN Works\n\nTraditional vector search:\n```\nQuery → HNSW Index → Top K Results\n```\n\nRuVector with GNN:\n```\nQuery → HNSW Index → GNN Layer → Enhanced Results\n                ↑                      │\n                └──── learns from ─────┘\n```\n\nThe GNN layer:\n1. Takes your query and its nearest neighborsa\n2. Applies multi-head attention to weigh which neighbors matter\n3. Updates representations based on graph structure\n4. Returns better-ranked results\n\nOver time, frequently-accessed paths get reinforced, making common queries faster and more accurate.\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### One-Line Install\n \n\n### Node.js / Browser\n\n```bash\n# Install\nnpm install ruvector\n\n# Or try instantly\nnpx ruvector\n```\n\n\n## Comparison\n\n| Feature | RuVector | Pinecone | Qdrant | Milvus | ChromaDB |\n|---------|----------|----------|--------|--------|----------|\n| **Latency (p50)** | **61µs** | ~2ms | ~1ms | ~5ms | ~50ms |\n| **Memory (1M vec)** | 200MB* | 2GB | 1.5GB | 1GB | 3GB |\n| **Graph Queries** | ✅ Cypher | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Hyperedges** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Self-Learning (GNN)** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Runtime Adaptation (SONA)** | ✅ LoRA+EWC++ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **AI Agent Routing** | ✅ Tiny Dancer | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Attention Mechanisms** | ✅ 39 types | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Hyperbolic Embeddings** | ✅ Poincaré | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **PostgreSQL Extension** | ✅ pgvector drop-in | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **SIMD Optimization** | ✅ AVX-512/NEON | Partial | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Metadata Filtering** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| **Sparse Vectors** | ✅ BM25/TF-IDF | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Raft Consensus** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Multi-Master Replication** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Auto-Sharding** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Auto-Compression** | ✅ 2-32x | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Snapshots/Backups** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |\n| **Browser/WASM** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Differentiable** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |\n| **Multi-Tenancy** | ✅ Collections | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n| **Open Source** | ✅ MIT | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n*With PQ8 compression.
