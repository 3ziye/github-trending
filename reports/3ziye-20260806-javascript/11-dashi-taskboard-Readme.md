# Codex Taskboard

A local-first issue board that runs in a browser and can be embedded in Codex through the standalone CDP launcher or its injection script. The same HTTP API powers the React UI and the `taskctl` CLI used by the bundled Codex Skill.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.5 or newer

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:47823>. The SQLite database is stored at `.data/taskboard.sqlite`.

For development with live frontend reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Vite UI runs at <http://127.0.0.1:5173> and proxies API requests to the local service.

## Use the CLI

Run it from the project:

```bash
npm run taskctl -- project create \
  --id my-project \
  --name "My project" \
  --workspace-path /absolute/path/to/repository

npm run taskctl -- issue create \
  --project my-project \
  --title "Implement the next slice" \
  --status todo \
  --priority high \
  --labels product,mvp
```

Use `npm link` if you want `taskctl` on your shell path. Set `CODEX_TASKBOARD_URL` to point the CLI at another local or LAN service. Cloud deployments are configured through the loopback companion with `taskctl cloud login`.

## Install the Codex Skill

Copy or symlink `skills/manage-taskboard` into the Codex skills directory, then start a new Codex task:

```bash
ln -s /absolute/path/to/codex-taskboard/skills/manage-taskboard \
  ~/.codex/skills/manage-taskboard
```

The Skill teaches Codex to inspect an issue, move it to `in_progress`, use optimistic versions, verify the work, and then move it to `in_review`; it moves the issue to `done` only after the user explicitly confirms acceptance or asks to mark it complete.

## Embed in Codex

### Recommended: keep your current window and open a separate Taskboard window

Keep the existing Codex window open. From the Taskboard repository, start a second Codex instance with a dedicated CDP port:

```bash
open -n -a /Applications/ChatGPT.app --args \
  --remote-debugging-port=9231 \
  --remote-allow-origins=http://127.0.0.1:9231
```

After the new Codex window appears, run the injector in another terminal:

```bash
CODEX_TASKBOARD_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
npm run codex:inject -- --port 9231 --open
```

Keep the injector terminal running while using the embedded panel. The original Codex window remains unchanged, and the new window receives the Taskboard sidebar entry. If port `9231` is occupied, use another port in both commands.

### Alternative: restart Codex with the standalone launcher

Quit every running Codex window, then run:

```bash
CODEX_TASKBOARD_HOST=127.0.0.1 npm run codex
```

This starts the local Taskboard service when needed, launches the official macOS Codex app with a loopback-only CDP port, injects a native-looking Taskboard entry after Plugins, and keeps watching both the service and replacement renderers. Opening Taskboard asks this launcher to health-check the fixed local service, restart it when needed, and rebuild a failed iframe. Keep this command running while using the embedded panel. The launcher does not modify `ChatGPT.app` or its `app.asar`.

Codex 26.715.52143 ships a renderer CSP that blocks arbitrary HTTP iframes. The launcher therefore enables CDP CSP bypass, reloads that renderer once, installs the document-start script, and waits until the Taskboard OOPIF is actually loaded. CDP is unauthenticated to other processes on the same machine, so only run trusted local code while the launcher is active.

To inject into a Codex instance that was already launched with CDP by another method, run:

```bash
npm run codex:inject -- --port 9229 --open
```

This command also stays resident so the injected tab can restart Taskboard after a service exit. Stop it with `Ctrl-C`.

The script adds a Taskboard entry to the Codex sidebar and renders the iframe across Codex's complete main workspace, including the contextual titlebar area so Taskboard's own header does not leave an empty strip. That full rectangular header is placed above Electron's draggable layer and marked `no-drag`; because the native contextual actions are suppressed while Taskboard is active, its own actions use their normal edge padding without an artificial right-side gap. The native sidebar stays mounted, while the previous page selection and contextual header are temporarily suppressed; choosing another Codex page restores them.

“在对话中打开” selects the corresponding native Codex project when one is available and opens an unsent native composer with `$manage-taskboard ISSUE-ID`. A conversation is attributed only after it actually processes the issue: `taskctl` reads Codex's `CODEX_THREAD_ID` and records that ID on the issue or comment mutation. Recorded IDs are clickable through Codex's native route bridge. Each issue can bind either one Git branch or one worktree; the options are scanned from the selected Codex project's repository instead of being typed by hand. The integration uses Codex's existing project, composer, and route markers; it does not
