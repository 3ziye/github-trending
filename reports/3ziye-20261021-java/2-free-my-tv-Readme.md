## What you get

- **No ads.** No sponsored rows, banners or autoplaying promos. Not one.
- **Your apps, front and center.** The streaming apps you actually use, on a glass shelf. Pick them and their order right on the TV.
- **Trending, not sponsored.** Three fresh picks every hour from what's trending this week and the latest releases, only from apps you already have. Movies and Shows get their own tabs.
- **Weather and markets, one press away.** The hour-by-hour forecast, sunrise and sunset, and live crypto prices.
- **Light by day, dark by night.** It follows your city's real sunset, the way your phone does.
- **A screensaver to match.** Full-screen photos of the picks with a big glass clock.
- **Fast.** 60 fps, every frame in 16.6 ms, on the TV's own chip. The home screen uses 96 MB of memory instead of 242 MB (−60%).<br><sub>Measured on a 98″ TCL Google TV running Android 14.</sub>
- **Set up on the TV.** Language, your city, temperature, theme, the weather and prices cards, which coins, and the apps on the shelf, in Free My TV's own settings.
- **Safe.** No root. Nothing is uninstalled. One button brings back the factory home screen.

## Install

About ten minutes. You need a Google TV or Android TV (Android 9 or newer) and a computer on the same Wi-Fi.

### The easy way: Claude Code

1. **On the TV**, turn on developer mode: Settings → System → About → press *Android TV OS build* 7 times. Then Settings → System → Developer options → turn on **USB debugging**. Write down the TV's IP address (Settings → Network & Internet).
2. **On your computer**, get the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simbasjungles/free-my-tv && cd free-my-tv
   ```
3. **Open [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) in that folder** and say:
   > Install Free My TV on my TV at 192.168.1.50. I live in Lisbon.

   It installs the tools it needs, builds the app and puts it on your TV. Swap in your TV's IP and your city.
4. **On the TV**, open *Free My TV* → *Home Screen* → *Free My TV*, and accept the debugging prompt (tick *Always allow*).

### The manual way

1. **On the TV**, do step 1 above.
2. **Tools:** a JDK (17+), the Android SDK command-line tools (build-tools 34, platform android-34) and adb. On a Mac:
   ```bash
   brew install --cask temurin android-commandlinetools android-platform-tools
   sdkmanager "build-tools;34.0.0" "platforms;android-34"
   ```
   On Linux, get OpenJDK 17, Android's command-line tools and adb from your package manager, then run the same `sdkmanager` line. On Windows, use WSL.
3. **Build:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
   The first run creates `config.properties`. Set your city and your [TMDB key](#the-tmdb-key) there, then run it again.
4. **Install:**
   ```bash
   adb connect 192.168.1.50:5555
   adb install -r FreeMyTV.apk
   ```
   On TCL TVs, also let it run in the background (TCL blocks it by default, and the switch never starts):
   ```bash
   adb shell "appops set io.freemytv AUTO_START allow || appops set io.freemytv APP_AUTO_START allow"
   ```
5. **On the TV**, open *Free My TV* → *Home Screen* → *Free My TV*.

## LG TVs (webOS)

The same home screen as an LG app: the picks, the glass shelf with your apps, the drawer with inputs, weather and prices, day and night, Home Settings and the shelf editor. It installs through LG's own Developer Mode, with nothing rooted or changed on the TV. LG's home screen stays where it is, and Free My TV is one press of a number key away.

You need an LG TV (webOS 3 or newer) and a computer on the same Wi-Fi, with Python 3.

1. **On the TV**, open the LG Content Store and install **Developer Mode**. Sign in with a free [LG developer account](https://webostv.developer.lge.com), turn on **Dev Mode Status** (the TV restarts), then turn on **Key Server**. Write down the IP address and the passphrase it shows.
2. **On your computer**, get the code and build. `config.properties` works as for Google TV (your city, your [TMDB key](#the-tmdb-key)):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simbasjungles/free-my-tv && cd free-my-tv
   python3 webos/build.py
   ```
3. **Install.** The first time, it asks for the TV's passphrase; updates don't:
   ```bash
   python3 webos/install.py 192.168.1.50
   ```
4. **On the TV**, while Free My TV is open, hold a number key on the remote. From the
