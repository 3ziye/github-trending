# 🍌 Pico-Banana-400K: A Large-Scale Dataset for Text-Guided Image Editing

<font size=7><div align='center' > [[📖 Paper](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19808)]  </div></font>

**Pico-Banana-400K** is a large-scale dataset of **~400K text–image–edit triplets** designed to advance research in **text-guided image editing**.  
Each example contains:
- an **original image** (from [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/factsfigures.html)),  
- a **human-like edit instruction**, and  
- the **edited result** generated by Nano-Banana and verified by Gemini-2.5-Pro.

The dataset spans **35 edit operations** across **8 semantic categories**, covering diverse transformations—from low-level color adjustments to high-level object, scene, and stylistic edits.

## 🏗️ Dataset Construction

Pico-Banana-400K is built using a **two-stage multimodal generation pipeline**:

1. **Instruction Generation**  
   Each Open Images sample is passed to *Gemini-2.5-Flash*, which writes concise, natural-language editing instructions grounded in visible content. We also provide short instructions summarized by Qwen-2.5-Instruct-7B. 
   Example:  
   ```json
   {
     "instruction": "Change the red car to blue."
   }
   

2. **Editing + Self-Evaluation**
   The Nano-Banana model performs the edit, then automatically evaluates the result using a structured quality prompt that measures:
   Instruction Compliance (40%)
   Editing Realism (25%)
   Preservation Balance (20%)
   Technical Quality (15%)
   Only edits scoring above a strict threshold (~0.7) are labeled as successful, forming the main dataset; the remaining ~56K are retained as failure cases for robustness and preference learning.
