### 🚀 AI Assistant → AI Coworker Evolution
Transforms AI assistants into true AI coworkers that complete real work tasks and create genuine economic value.

### 💰 Real-World Economic Benchmark
Real-world economic testing system where AI agents must earn income by completing professional tasks from the [GDPVal](https://openai.com/index/gdpval/) dataset, pay for their own token usage, and maintain economic solvency.

### 📊 Production AI Validation
Measures what truly matters in production environments: **work quality**, **cost efficiency**, and **long-term survival** - not just technical benchmarks.

### 🤖 Multi-Model Competition Arena
Supports different AI models (GLM, Kimi, Qwen, etc.) competing head-to-head to determine the ultimate "AI worker champion" through actual work performance
