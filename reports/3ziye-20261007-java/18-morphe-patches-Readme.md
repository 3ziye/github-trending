| Patch | Description | Options |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| [120 refresh rate](#120-refresh-rate) | Lifts the 60 Hz limit Maps puts on itself, on the app and on the map, so it can run at your screen's full refresh rate (such as 120 Hz). Uses more battery, most of all while navigating. Off by default: switch it on on the Customization screen. |  |
| [Better offline maps](#better-offline-maps) | Reworks the offline area picker: zooming out really selects more instead of being shrunk to Google's size cap, the box can be resized by dragging its edges and corners, a large area is split into several downloads whose true total size is shown, and areas already downloaded are drawn on the map. Can be turned off on the Customization screen. |  |
| [Black theme](#black-theme) | AMOLED-black theme. Pins Maps' own dark mode and its separate navigation colour scheme, and remaps colour resources, drawable fills and draw-time paints so no surface is left grey. |  |
| [Blue pin](#blue-pin) | Chromium-coloured flat map pin on every in-app product logo and the search bar's leading icon. |  |
| [Bypass Play Services checks](#bypass-play-services-checks) | Makes Maps' bundled Play services signature and availability checks always pass, so it runs re-signed and with Play services disabled or absent. |  |
| [Change app name](#change-app-name) | Sets the launcher and in-app app name. | • App name |
| [Change package name](#change-package-name) | Installs alongside stock Google Maps under its own package name. On by default, because stock Maps comes built into most phones and cannot be replaced by a patched copy. | • Package name |
| [Customization screen](#customization-screen) | Adds a Customization row under Settings on the account sheet, with switches for the patches here that can be turned back off inside the app. |  |
| [Hide AI](#hide-ai) | Hides Gemini's AI summaries: the "Know before you go" card on place sheets and the review summary ("Summarized with Gemini") on the Reviews tab. Can be switched off on the Customization screen. |  |
| [Hide ads](#hide-ads) | Hides promoted map pins and "Sponsored" search result rows. |  |
| [Hide explore feed](#hide-explore-feed) | Hides the home tab's Explore feed sheet ("Local vibe"). Can be switched back on on the Customization screen. |  |
| [Hide login promo](#hide-login-promo) | Hides the full-screen "Make it your map" page shown on first launch. |  |
| [Hide navigation tabs](#hide-navigation-tabs) | Hides the Explore / Contribute / You strip at the bottom of the home screen. Can be switched back on on the Customization screen. |  |
| [Hide section title](#hide-section-title) | Removes the "More from this app" label from the account sheet. |  |
| [Hide sign-in button](#hide-sign-in-button) | Removes the "Sign in" pill from the account sheet. |  |
| [Hide suggestions](#hide-suggestions) | Hides the row of businesses under an address on its place sheet: a preview of the addre
