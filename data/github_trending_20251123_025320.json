Designed for broad accessibility, it enables new languages to be added with just a few paired examples without requiring specialized expertise or large datasets. By combining scalable zero-shot learning with a flexible model family, Omnilingual ASR aims to make speech technology more inclusive and adaptable for communities and researchers worldwide.\n\n* [Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/omniasr-transcriptions)\n* [Huggingface Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/omnilingual-asr-corpus)\n* [Paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/omnilingual-asr-open-source-multilingual-speech-recognition-for-1600-languages/)\n* [Blogpost](http://ai.meta.com/blog/omnilingual-asr-advancing-automatic-speech-recognition)\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./result_table.png\" alt=\"Performance results table\" width=\"100%\" />\n  <p><i>Our 7B-LLM-ASR system achieves state-of-the-art performance across 1,600+ languages, with character error rates (CER) below 10 for 78% of those languages.</i></p>\n</div>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Quick Start\n- **[Installation & Basic Usage](#installation)** - Setup and first transcription\n- **[Inference Pipeline](src/omnilingual_asr/models/inference/README.md)** - Comprehensive transcription guide with batch processing, language conditioning, and context examples\n- **[Supported Languages](#supported-languages)** - View the complete list of 1600+ supported languages\n\n\n### Models & Architecture\n- **[Model Specifications](#model-architectures)** - Available models, parameters, and memory requirements\n- **[Architecture Overview](src/omnilingual_asr/models/README.md)** - Technical details on W2V, CTC, and LLM model families\n- **[Asset Management](src/omnilingual_asr/cards/README.md)** - Configuration system for models, tokenizers, and datasets\n\n### Training & Data Pipeline\n- **[Data Preparation](workflows/dataprep/README.md)** - End-to-end guide for multilingual dataset preparation, HuggingFace integration, and parquet processing\n- **[Training Recipes](workflows/recipes/wav2vec2/asr/README.md)** - Pre-configured workflows for CTC and LLM model training\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nThe models were developed using [fairseq2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2), a research-focused sequence modeling toolkit. While we provide a **reference** inference pipeline that works across platforms, audio support requires [libsndfile](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2?tab=readme-ov-file#system-dependencies) (Mac: `brew install libsndfile`; Windows may need an additional [setup](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq2?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-on-windows)).\n\n```bash\n# using pip\npip install omnilingual-asr\n\n# using uv\nuv add omnilingual-asr\n```\n\n## Inference\n\n```python\nfrom omnilingual_asr.models.inference.pipeline import ASRInferencePipeline\n\npipeline = ASRInferencePipeline(model_card=\"omniASR_LLM_7B\")\n\naudio_files = [\"/path/to/eng_audio1.flac\", \"/path/to/deu_audio2.wav\"]\nlang = [\"eng_Latn\", \"deu_Latn\"]\ntranscriptions = pipeline.transcribe(audio_files, lang=lang, batch_size=2)\n```\n\nMore details on running specific models can be found in the [src/omnilingual_asr/models/inference](/src/omnilingual_asr/models/inference/README.md) directory.\n\n> **⚠️ Important:** Currently only audio files shorter than 40 seconds are accepted for inference. We plan to add support for transcribing unlimited-length audio files shortly.\n\n### Supported Languages\n\nTo view the full list of 1600+ supported languages, you can access the language list [programmatically](/src/omnilingual_asr/models/wav2vec2_llama/lang_ids.py):\n\n```python\nfrom omnilingual_asr.models.wav2vec2_llama.lang_ids import supported_langs\n\n# Print all supported languages\nprint(f\"Total supported languages: {len(supported_langs)}\")\nprint(supported_langs)\n\n# Check if a specific language is supported\nif \"eng_Latn\" in supported_langs:\n    print(\"English (Latin script) is supported!\")\n```\n\nLanguages follow the format `{language_code}_{script}`, for example `eng_Latn` - English (Latin script), `cmn_Hans` - Mandarin Chinese (Simplified), ...\n\n### Using the HuggingFace Dataset 🤗\n\nWe provide a large-scale multilingual speech dataset on HuggingFace under CC-BY-4.0 License: [`facebook/omnilingual-asr-corpus`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/omnilingual-asr-corpus).\nThis dataset can be directly used with our inference pipeline for evaluation or testing:\n\n```bash\npip install \"omnilingual-asr[dat",

This makes it very easy to copy paste the contents of a chapter to an LLM, to read along. Basically - get epub books (e.g. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) has many), open them up in this reader, copy paste text around to your favorite LLM, and read together and along.\n\nThis project was 90% vibe coded just to illustrate how one can very easily [read books together with LLMs](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1990577951671509438). I'm not going to support it in any way, it's provided here as is for other people's inspiration and I don't intend to improve it. Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over, ask your LLM to change it in whatever way you like.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). So for example, download [Dracula EPUB3](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345) to this directory as `dracula.epub`, then:\n\n```bash\nuv run reader3.py dracula.epub\n```\n\nThis creates the directory `dracula_data`, which registers the book to your local library. We can then run the server:\n\n```bash\nuv run server.py\n```\n\nAnd visit [localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123/) to see your current Library. You can easily add more books, or delete them from your library by deleting the folder. It's not supposed to be complicated or complex.\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

It particularly excels in efficient and high-quality long video generation, representing our first step toward world models.\n\n### Key Features\n- 🌟 **Unified architecture for multiple tasks**: LongCat-Video unifies *Text-to-Video*, *Image-to-Video*, and *Video-Continuation* tasks within a single video generation framework. It natively supports all these tasks with a single model and consistently delivers strong performance across each individual task.\n- 🌟 **Long video generation**: LongCat-Video is natively pretrained on *Video-Continuation* tasks, enabling it to produce minutes-long videos without color drifting or quality degradation.\n- 🌟 **Efficient inference**: LongCat-Video generates $720p$, $30fps$ videos within minutes by employing a coarse-to-fine generation strategy along both the temporal and spatial axes. Block Sparse Attention further enhances efficiency, particularly at high resolutions\n- 🌟 **Strong performance with multi-reward RLHF**: Powered by multi-reward Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), comprehensive evaluations on both internal and public benchmarks demonstrate that LongCat-Video achieves performance comparable to leading open-source video generation models as well as the latest commercial solutions.\n\nFor more detail, please refer to the comprehensive [***LongCat-Video Technical Report***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22200).\n\n## 🎥 Teaser Video\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00fa63f0-9c4e-461a-a79e-c662ad596d7d\" width=\"2264\" height=\"384\"> </video>\n</div>\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Installation\n\nClone the repo:\n\n```shell\ngit clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video\ncd LongCat-Video\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```shell\n# create conda environment\nconda create -n longcat-video python=3.10\nconda activate longcat-video\n\n# install torch (configure according to your CUDA version)\npip install torch==2.6.0+cu124 torchvision==0.21.0+cu124 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124\n\n# install flash-attn-2\npip install ninja \npip install psutil \npip install packaging \npip install flash_attn==2.7.4.post1\n\n# install other requirements\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nFlashAttention-2 is enabled in the model config by default; you can also change the model config (\"./weights/LongCat-Video/dit/config.json\") to use FlashAttention-3 or xformers once installed.\n\n### Model Download\n\n| Models | Download Link |\n| --- | --- |\n| LongCat-Video | 🤗 [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video) |\n\nDownload models using huggingface-cli:\n```shell\npip install \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\nhuggingface-cli download meituan-longcat/LongCat-Video --local-dir ./weights/LongCat-Video\n```\n\n### Run Text-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_text_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_text_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Image-to-Video\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_image_to_video.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_image_to_video.py --context_parallel_size=2 --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n```\n\n### Run Video-Continuation\n\n```shell\n# Single-GPU inference\ntorchrun run_demo_video_continuation.py --checkpoint_dir=./weights/LongCat-Video --enable_compile\n\n# Multi-GPU inference\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 run_demo_video_continuation.py --context_parallel_size=2 -",

Install Dependencies\n\nInstall dependencies using `uv`:\n\n```bash\nuv sync\n```\n\n### 3. Environment Variables\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the `karpathy` directory with your API keys:\n\n```bash\nOPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here\nAGENT_MODEL=your_model_name_here\n```\n\nThe `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required for the agent to function properly.\n\nThis is the same environment variable that will be copied to the `sandbox` directory so the agents can use any API keys you provide here.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nRun the startup script to set up the sandbox and start the ADK web interface:\n\n```bash\npython start.py\n```\n\nThis automatically:\n1. Creates a `sandbox` directory with scientific skills from Claude Scientific Skills\n2. Sets up a Python virtual environment with ML packages (PyTorch, transformers, scikit-learn, etc.)\n3. Copies your `.env` file to the sandbox\n4. Starts the ADK web interface\n5. Navigate to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser\n6. Select `karpathy` in the top left under 'Select an agent'\n7. All outputs will be in the `sandbox` directory so continue to monitor that as you converse with the agent\n\n**Note:** Any files you want the agent to use (datasets, scripts, etc.) should be manually added to the `sandbox` directory.\n\n## Community\n\nJoin our K-Dense Slack community to connect with other users, share ideas, and get support:\n\n**[Join K-Dense Slack Community](https://join.slack.com/t/k-densecommunity/shared_invite/zt-3iajtyls1-EwmkwIZk0g_o74311Tkf5g)**\n\n## Claude Scientific Skills\n\nThis repository is designed to work with the **[Claude Scientific Skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills)** collection of ready-to-use scientific tools and workflows ([link](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills)). The `start.py` setup script creates a `sandbox` that includes scientific skills from this collection so the `karpathy` agent can leverage specialized ML libraries and scientific workflows. For full details on the skills themselves, see the upstream repository’s README and documentation [here](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills).\n\n## Manual Usage\n\nTo set up the sandbox without starting the web interface:\n\n```bash\npython -m karpathy.utils\n```\n\n**Note:** Any files you want the agent to use (datasets, scripts, etc.) should be manually added to the `sandbox` directory.\n\nTo run the ADK web interface manually:\n\n```bash\nadk web\n```\n\nThen navigate to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.\n\n## Enhanced ML Capabilities\n\nIf you want substantially more powerful ML capabilities through a multi-agentic system, sign up for [www.k-dense.ai](https://www.k-dense.ai). Currently in closed beta, launching publicly in December 2025.\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n- **Modal sandbox integration** - Choose any type of compute you want\n- **K-Dense Web features** - We might make some features from K-Dense Web available here based on interest\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=K-Dense-AI/karpathy&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#K-Dense-AI/karpathy&type=date&legend=top-left)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis project is **not** endorsed by or affiliated with Andrej Karpathy.

      "readme": "\n# CodeAssist - AI Programming Assistant\n\nCodeAssist is a completely private and local AI coding assistant, developed by Gensyn. It helps you practice programming problems and train a novel assistant to help you code.\n\nUnlike typical code assistants, CodeAssist writes directly in your editor as you work. Every keystroke - whether you type, fix, delete, or leave its output untouched - becomes a learning signal. Over time, it adapts to your habits and style, acting more like an apprentice learning from your craft than a tool following commands.\n\n[Docs](https://docs.gensyn.ai/testnet/codeassist) | [Tutorial](https://docs.gensyn.ai/testnet/codeassist/using-codeassist) | [Leaderboard](https://dashboard.gensyn.ai/?application=CodeAssist)\n\n# Installation\n\nGet started with installing CodeAssist.\n\n## Docker\n\nInstall [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your system, according to the instructions for your machine.\n\n## Python\n\nPython is required to run the main script that handles your environment. We require a version no older than 3.10.\n\n## UV\n\nUV is required to manage the dependencies of the main script. It can be installed with the following steps:\n\n### MacOS\n\n```bash\nbrew install uv\n```\n\n### Linux (or alternate MacOS install, for those without Brew)\n\n```bash\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n# Downloading the Code\n\nTo download the code, simply clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/codeassist.git\ncd codeassist\n```\n\n# Running\n\nTo run CodeAssist, simply execute the following command:\n\n```bash\nuv run run.py\n```\n\n## HuggingFace Token\n\nTo start CodeAssist, you will need to have a HuggingFace token. Follow [these instructions](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) and generate a token with `Write` access.\n\n## Web UI\n\nAfter the script is running, your browser should open automatically but if it doesn't, open a window and go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to open CodeAssist.\n\nWhen the web UI loads, you'll see a login modal where you can log in with email (which sends a one-time passcode) or with Google. After logging in for the first time, your local credentials will be stored in `persistent-data/auth/userKeyMap.json`.\n\nOnce logged in, you can select Easy, Medium, or Hard problems from the sidebar. CodeAssist will begin recording an episode. Every click, keystroke, edit, or deletion is logged as training feedback.\n\nWhen you stop typing, CodeAssist takes initiative. It writes directly into your file without any pop-ups or confirmations. Whether you accept, modify, or remove its edits, each interaction contributes to the model’s understanding of your preferences.\n\n### Tips & Tricks\n\n- Use `Shift+Space` or click the Pause Assistant button to temporarily stop the assistant. The first keystroke after pausing will unpause it.\n- Keep your cursor near the section you're working on, as CodeAssist inserts code relative to your cursor position.\n- When the assistant produces a \"No-Op\" (does nothing), it's waiting for you. This is intentional and signals it's your turn to act.\n\n## Training\n\nCodeAssist continuously records your interactions while the web UI is running. To complete an episode and train your model, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where CodeAssist is running.\n\nYou do not need to successfully solve a LeetCode problem to train the model. You can stop recording the episode by leaving the CodeAssist web UI, returning to the terminal CodeAssist is running in, and using the `ctrl+c` command to start training.\n\nDuring training, CodeAssist will:\n- Compare your edits to the assistant's actions\n- Calculate rewards and penalties based on your interactions\n- Update your local model checkpoint\n- Store new model weights under `persistent-data/trainer/models`\n- Upload your trained model to Hugging Face (if a valid token is provided)\n\nAfter training completes (which takes a few minutes depending on your system), you can restart CodeAssist to use your updated model trained on your most recent episode.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n- **Be patient**: The assistant watches your typing and timing. Working too quickly or aggressively correcting can neutralize training efficacy.\n- **Treat it as a collaborator**: Let it naturally interject code and keep useful code around briefly before editing or removing.\n- **Don't delete everything instantly**: If you delete everything it writes right away, you're teaching it to stop acting altogether.\n- **Record multiple varied problems**: Diversify its learning signals by working on different problems.\n- **Expect gradual improvement**: Early episodes may feel inconsistent. Improvement becomes clearer after 4-5 episodes of training.\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## Exception: Container <container-name> is unhealthy.\n\nThis occurs when a container fails to boot. You can view the logs by running `docker logs <container-name>`. Please review and upload the logs when creating a new issue.\n\n## Error connecting to Docker daemon\n\n```\n2025-09-04 ",

Get API Key\n\nMiniMax provides both global and China platforms. Choose based on your network environment:\n\n| Version    | Platform                                                       | API Base                   |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| **Global** | [https://platform.minimax.io](https://platform.minimax.io)     | `https://api.minimax.io`   |\n| **China**  | [https://platform.minimaxi.com](https://platform.minimaxi.com) | `https://api.minimaxi.com` |\n\n**Steps to get API Key:**\n1. Visit the corresponding platform to register and login\n2. Go to **Account Management > API Keys**\n3. Click **\"Create New Key\"**\n4. Copy and save it securely (key is only shown once)\n\n> 💡 **Tip**: Remember the API Base address corresponding to your chosen platform, you'll need it for configuration\n\n### 2. Choose Your Usage Mode\n\n**Prerequisites: Install uv**\n\nBoth usage modes require uv. If you don't have it installed:\n\n```bash\n# macOS/Linux/WSL\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Windows (PowerShell)\npython -m pip install --user pipx\npython -m pipx ensurepath\n# Restart PowerShell after installation\n\n# After installation, restart your terminal or run:\nsource ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc (macOS/Linux)\n```\n\nWe offer two usage modes - choose based on your needs:\n\n#### 🚀 Quick Start Mode (Recommended for Beginners)\n\nPerfect for users who want to quickly try Mini Agent without cloning the repository or modifying code.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install directly from GitHub\nuv tool install git+https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/Mini-Agent.git\n\n# 2. Run setup script (automatically creates config files)\n# macOS/Linux:\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiniMax-AI/Mini-Agent/main/scripts/setup-config.sh | bash\n\n# Windows (PowerShell):\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MiniMax-AI/Mini-Agent/main/scripts/setup-config.ps1\" -OutFile \"$env:TEMP\\setup-config.ps1\"\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"$env:TEMP\\setup-config.ps1\"\n```\n\n> 💡 **Tip**: If you want to develop locally or modify code, use \"Development Mode\" below\n\n**Configuration:**\n\nThe setup script creates config files in `~/.mini-agent/config/`. Edit the config file:\n\n```bash\n# Edit config file\nnano ~/.mini-agent/config/config.yaml\n```\n\nFill in your API Key and corresponding API Base:\n\n```yaml\napi_key: \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"          # API Key from step 1\napi_base: \"https://api.minimax.io\"  # Global\n",

LeJEPA introduces **Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg)**, a novel objective that constrains learned embeddings to an optimal isotropic Gaussian distribution, minimizing downstream prediction risk.\n**Key Features:**\n- Single trade-off hyperparameter\n- Linear time and memory complexity\n- Stable training across architectures and domains\n- Heuristics-free implementation (no stop-gradient, teacher–student, or schedulers)\n- Distributed training-friendly codebase (~50 lines of core code)\n- State-of-the-art results across 10+ datasets and 60+ architectures\n---\n\n## GOTO hyperparameters\n\n\nOur data augmentation strategy follows a multi-crop approach inspired by DINO, where we generate multiple views of each image at different scales to encourage the model to learn both global semantic information and local fine-grained features.\n\n### Data augmentation and views\n\nEach training image is augmented to produce **2 global views** and **6 local views** with different spatial scales but the same set of color and geometric transformations:\n| **Global Views** | **Local Views** |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| **RandomResizedCrop**<br>- Resolution: 224x224<br>- Scale: (0.3, 1.0)<br>- Covers 30-100% of the image | **RandomResizedCrop**<br>- Resolution: 98x98<br>- Scale: (0.05, 0.3)<br>- Covers 5-30% of the image |\n| **RandomHorizontalFlip** (p=0.5) | **RandomHorizontalFlip** (p=0.5) |\n| **ColorJitter** (p=0.8)<br>- Brightness: 0.4<br>- Contrast: 0.4<br>- Saturation: 0.2<br>- Hue: 0.1 | **ColorJitter** (p=0.8)<br>- Brightness: 0.4<br>- Contrast: 0.4<br>- Saturation: 0.2<br>- Hue: 0.1 |\n| **RandomGrayscale** (p=0.2) | **RandomGrayscale** (p=0.2) |\n| **GaussianBlur** (p=0.5) | **GaussianBlur** (p=0.5) |\n| **RandomSolarize** (p=0.2, threshold=128) | **RandomSolarize** (p=0.2, threshold=128) |\n| **Normalization** (mean, std) | **Normalization** (mean, std) |\n\n\nThe key difference between global and local views is the **cropping scale**: global views capture larger portions of the image to learn high-level semantics, while local views focus on smaller regions to learn fine-grained local patterns.

Instead of predicting one discrete token at a time, CALM learns to predict a single **continuous vector** that represents an entire chunk of **K** tokens. \n\nThis is achieved through a two-stage process:\n1.  **A high-fidelity autoencoder** learns to compress K tokens into a single vector and reconstruct them with near-perfect accuracy.\n2.  **A continuous-domain language model** then performs autoregressive prediction in this vector space.\n\nAn in-depth explanation of CALM is available in [this blog](https://shaochenze.github.io/blog/2025/CALM).\n\n### Key Features\n\n*   🚀 **Ultra-Efficient by Design:** Dramatically improves training and inference efficiency by reducing the number of autoregressive steps by a factor of K. \n\n*   💡 **A New Scaling Axis:** Introduces a new scaling dimension for LLMs—**semantic bandwidth (K)**. Instead of just scaling parameters and data, you can now scale the amount of information processed in a single step.\n\n*   🛠️ **A Comprehensive Likelihood-Free Toolkit:** Operating in a continuous domain requires new tools. This repository provides the full suite of algorithms that make CALM possible:\n    *   **A Robust Autoencoder** to learn high-fidelity continuous representations of token chunks.\n    *   **Energy-Based Training**, a principled and likelihood-free method for generative modeling.\n    *   **BrierLM**, a new metric for calibrated, likelihood-free evaluation of language models.\n    *   **Temperature Sampling** for controlled, high-quality text generation using only a black-box sampler.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1.  Clone the Repository\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/shaochenze/calm.git\ncd calm\n```\n\n2.  Install Dependencies\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3.  Prepare the Training Data\n\nRun the following script to download and process the [pile-uncopyrighted](https://huggingface.co/datasets/monology/pile-uncopyrighted) dataset for training.\n```bash\nbash data/get_data.sh\n```\nThe dataset is large. Please ensure you have at least **2.5TB** of free disk space.\n\n## Training\n\nTo replicate the results for CALM with `K=4`, follow these steps. The training process is divided into two main stages: train the autoencoder and then train the CALM language model.\n\n### 1. Train the Autoencoder\n\nFirst, train the autoencoder on approximately 15B tokens of data. This model learns the mapping between token chunks and their continuous vector representations.\n\n```bash\nbash train/train_autoencoder.sh\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to see the full training script</summary>\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nWORK_PATH=/path/to/the/code\nCHECKPOINT_PATH=${WORK_PATH}/checkpoints/autoencoder\nTOKENIZER_PATH=${WORK_PATH}/llama3_tokenizer\nDATASET_TRAIN=${WORK_PATH}/pile-uncopyrighted/train/00.text.jsonl,${WORK_PATH}/pile-uncopyrighted/train/01.text.jsonl\nDATASET_VALID=${WORK_PATH}/data/wikitext_document_level-test.json\n\ntorchrun --nnodes 1 --node_rank 0 --nproc_per_node 8 \\\n    -m train.train_autoencoder \\\n    --tokenizer_name $TOKENIZER_PATH \\\n    --config_overrides \"latent_size=128,num_encoder_layers=2,num_decoder_layers=2,patch_size=4\" \\\n    --train_file $DATASET_TRAIN \\\n    --validation_file $DATASET_VALID \\\n    --keep_linebreaks True \\\n    --weight_decay 0.1 \\\n    --warmup_steps 1000 \\\n    --block_size 2048 \\\n    --adam_beta1 0.9 \\\n    --adam_beta2 0.95 \\\n    --max_grad_norm 1.0 \\\n    --streaming \\\n    --seed 1 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \\\n    --num_train_epochs 1 \\\n    --max_steps 30000 \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 10000 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --eval_steps 1000 \\\n    --learning_rate 3e-4 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"constant\" \\\n    --logging_steps 100 \\\n    --do_train \\\n    --do_eval \\\n    --save_safetensors False \\\n    --output_dir $CHECKPOINT_PATH \\\n    --overwrite_output_dir \\\n    --bf16 True\n```\n</details>\n\n### 2. Train the CALM Language Model\n\nOnce the autoencoder is trained, you can train the CALM model on the remaining data using our proposed **energy loss**. During evaluation steps, the **BrierLM score** is computed t",
