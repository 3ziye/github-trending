# Just talk to your agent — it learns and *EVOLVES*.

<p>Inspired by how brains learn. Meta-learn and evolve your 🦞 from every conversation in the wild. No GPU required.

### Two commands. That's it.

```bash
metaclaw setup              # one-time config wizard
metaclaw start              # default: madmax mode — skills + scheduled RL training
metaclaw start --daemon     # run in background, logs -> ~/.metaclaw/metaclaw.log
metaclaw start --daemon --log-file /tmp/metaclaw.log  # custom daemon log path
metaclaw start --mode rl    # RL without scheduler (trains immediately on full batch)
metaclaw start --mode skills_only  # skills only, no RL (no Tinker needed)
```

## 🔥 News

- **[03/25/2026]** **v0.4.0** — Contexture layer: MetaClaw now persists cross-session memory for users and projects. Relevant facts, preferences, and project history are automatically retrieved and injected into prompts. Includes adaptive memory policy, background consolidation, and an optional memory sidecar service.
- **[03/24/2026]** **v0.3.3** — One-click OpenClaw plugin: MetaClaw now ships as a native OpenClaw extension — drop the folder into OpenClaw's extensions, run one command, and everything is set up automatically.
- **[03/18/2026]** Our technical report "[MetaClaw: Just Talk -- An Agent That Meta-Learns and Evolves in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.17187)" is out! **🏆 Ranked No. 1** on [HuggingFace Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2603.17187)! Check it out!
- **[03/16/2026]** **v0.3.2** — Multi-claw support: IronClaw, PicoClaw, ZeroClaw, CoPaw, NanoClaw, and NemoClaw now supported alongside OpenClaw. NanoClaw connected via new `/v1/messages` Anthropic-compatible endpoint; NemoClaw via OpenShell inference routing. Added OpenRouter as a supported LLM platform.
- **[03/13/2026]** **v0.3.1** — MinT backend support: RL training now works with both Tinker and MinT. Configurable via `rl.backend` (auto/tinker/mint).
- **[03/13/2026]** **v0.3** — Continual meta-learning support: slow RL updates now only run during sleep hours, idle time, or Google Calendar meetings. Added support/query set separation to prevent stale reward signals from polluting model updates.
- **[03/11/2026]** **v0.2** — One-click deployment via `metaclaw` CLI. Skills enabled by default, RL is now opt-in.
- **[03/09/2026]** We release **MetaClaw** — Just talk to your agent and let it evolve automatically. **NO** GPU deployment required; just plug into the **API**.

## 📖 Overview

**MetaClaw is an agent that meta-learns and evolves in the wild.**
Just talk to your agent as you normally would — MetaClaw turns every live conversation into a learning signal, enabling the agent to continuously improve through real-world deployment rather than offline training alone.

Under the hood, it places your model behind a proxy that intercepts interactions from your personal agent (OpenClaw, CoPaw,
