      "readme": "# 🤖 `cagent` 🤖\n\n> A powerful, easy to use, customizable multi-agent runtime that orchestrates AI agents with\n> specialized capabilities and tools, and the interactions between agents.\n\n![cagent in action](docs/assets/cagent-run.gif)\n\n## ✨ What is `cagent`? ✨\n\n`cagent` lets you create and run intelligent AI agents, where each agent has\nspecialized knowledge, tools, and capabilities.\n\nThink of it as allowing you to quickly build, share and run a team of virtual experts that\ncollaborate to solve complex problems for you.\n\nAnd it's dead easy to use!\n\n⚠️ Note: `cagent` is in active development, **breaking changes are to be expected** ⚠️\n\n### Your First Agent\n\nExample [basic_agent.yaml](/examples/basic_agent.yaml):\n\nCreating agents with cagent is very simple. They are described in a short yaml file, like this one:\n\n```yaml\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.\n```\n\nRun it in a terminal with `cagent run basic_agent.yaml`.\n\nMany more examples can be found [here](/examples/README.md)!\n\n### Improving an agent with MCP tools\n\n`cagent` supports MCP servers, enabling agents to use a wide variety of external tools and services.\n\nIt supports three transport types: `stdio`, `http` and `sse`.\n\nGiving an agent access to tools via MCP is a quick way to greatly improve its capabilities, the quality of its results and its general useful-ness.\n\nGet started quickly with the [Docker MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/) and [catalog](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/catalog/)\n\nHere, we're giving the same basic agent from the example above access to a **containerized** `duckduckgo` mcp server and it's tools by using Docker's MCP Gateway:\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"2\"\n\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses.\n    toolsets:\n      - type: mcp\n        ref: docker:duckduckgo # stdio transport\n```\n\nWhen using a containerized server via the Docker MCP gateway, you can configure any required settings/secrets/authentication using the [Docker MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/#example-use-the-github-official-mcp-server) in Docker Desktop.\n\nAside from the containerized MCP severs the Docker MCP Gateway provides, any standard MCP server can be used with cagent!\n\nHere's an example similar to the above but adding `read_file` and `write_file` tools from the `rust-mcp-filesystem` MCP server:\n\n```yaml\nversion: \"2\"\n\nagents:\n  root:\n    model: openai/gpt-5-mini\n    description: A helpful AI assistant\n    instruction: |\n      You are a knowledgeable assistant that helps users with various tasks.\n      Be helpful, accurate, and concise in your responses. Write your search results to disk.\n    toolsets:\n      - type: mcp\n        ref: docker:duckduckgo\n      - type: mcp\n        command: rust-mcp-filesystem # installed with `cargo install rust-mcp-filesystem`\n        args: [\"--allow-write\", \".\"]\n        tools: [\"read_file\", \"write_file\"] # Optional: specific tools only\n        env:\n          - \"RUST_LOG=debug\"\n```\n\nSee [the USAGE docs](./docs/USAGE.md#tool-configuration) for more detailed information and examples\n\n### 🎯 Key Features\n\n- **🏗️ Multi-agent architecture** - Create specialized agents for different domains.\n- **🔧 Rich tool ecosystem** - Agents can use external tools and APIs via the MCP protocol.\n- **🔄 Smart delegation** - Agents can automatically route tasks to the most suitable specialist.\n- **📝 YAML configuration** - Declarative model and agent configuration.\n- **💭 Advanced reasoning** - Built-in \"think\", \"todo\" and \"memory\" tools for complex problem-solving.\n- **🌐 Multiple AI providers** - Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and [Docker Model Runner](https://docs.docker.com/ai/model-runner/).\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start 🚀\n\n### Installation\n\n[Prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases) for Windows, macOS and Linux can be found on the releases page of the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/docker/cagent/releases)\n\nOnce you've downloaded the appropriate binary for your platform, you may need to give it executable permissions.\nOn macOS and Linux, this is done with the following command:\n\n```sh\n# linux amd64 build example\nchmod +x /path/to/downloads/cagent-linux-amd64\n```\n\nYou can then rename the binary to `cagent` and configure your `PATH` to be able to find it (configuration varies by platform).\n\n### **Set your API keys**\n\nBased on the models you configure your agents to use, you will need to set the corresponding provider API key accordingly,\nall theses keys are optional, you will likely need at least one of these, though:\n\n```bash\n# For OpenAI",

      "readme": "## Blades\nBlades is a multimodal AI Agent framework in Go, supporting custom models, tools, memory, middleware, and more. It is well-suited for multi-turn conversations, chain reasoning, and structured output.\n> The name comes from the game God of War, set in Greek mythology, which tells the story of Kratos, who becomes a god of war and embarks on a divine slaughter. Blades are Kratos's iconic weapons.\n\n## Architecture Design\nBlades leverages the characteristics of Go to provide a flexible and efficient AI Agent solution. Its core lies in achieving high decoupling and extensibility through a unified interface and pluggable components. The overall architecture is as follows:\n![architecture](./docs/images/architecture.png)\n\n- **Go Idiomatic**: Built entirely in the Go way, the code style and user experience make Go developers feel at home.\n- **Easy to Use**: Through concise code, define an AI Agent and quickly deliver requirements, making complex logic clear, easy to manage, and maintain.\n- **Middleware Ecosystem**: Drawing inspiration from Kratos’s middleware design philosophy, features like Observability, Guardrails, and others can be easily integrated into the AI Agent.\n- **Highly Extensible**: Through a unified interface and pluggable components, achieve high decoupling and extensibility, making it easy to integrate different LLM models and external tools.\n\n## Core Concepts\nThe Blades framework achieves its powerful functionality and flexibility through a series of well-designed core components. These components work together to build the intelligent behavior of the Agent:\n\n* **Agent (Intelligent Entity)**: The core unit that executes tasks, capable of invoking models and tools.\n* **Prompt (Prompt Text)**: A templated text used to interact with LLMs, supporting dynamic variable substitution and complex context construction.\n* **Chain (Chain)**: Links multiple Agents or other Chains to form complex workflows.\n* **ModelProvider (Model)**: A pluggable LLM interface, allowing you to easily switch and integrate different language model services (such as OpenAI).\n* **Tool (Tool)**: External capabilities that the Agent can use, such as calling APIs, querying databases, accessing file systems, etc.\n* **Memory (Memory)**: Provides short-term or long-term memory capabilities for the Agent, enabling context-aware continuous conversations.\n* **Middleware (Middleware)**: Similar to middleware in web frameworks, it can implement cross-cutting control over the Agent.\n\n### Runner\n`Runner` is the most core interface in the Blades framework, defining the basic behavior of all executable components. Its design aims to provide a unified execution paradigm, achieving **decoupling, standardization, and high composability** of various functional modules within the framework through the `Run` and `RunStream` methods. Components such as `Agent`, `Chain`, and `ModelProvider` all implement this interface, unifying their execution logic and allowing different components to be flexibly combined like LEGO bricks to build complex AI Agents.\n\n```go\n// Runner represents an entity that can process prompts and generate responses.\ntype Runner interface {\n    // Run performs a synchronous, non-streaming operation, returning a complete Generation result.\n    Run(context.Context, *Prompt, ...ModelOption) (*Generation, error)\n    // RunStream performs an asynchronous, streaming operation, returning a Streamer for receiving Generation results step by step.\n    RunStream(context.Context, *Prompt, ...ModelOption) (Streamer[*Generation], error)\n}\n```\n![runner](docs/images/runner.png)\n\n### ModelProvider\n`ModelProvider` is the core abstraction layer in the `Blades` framework for interacting with underlying large language models (LLMs). Its design goal is to achieve **decoupling and extensibility** through a unified interface, separating the framework's core logic from the implementation details of specific models (such as OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.). It acts as an adapter, responsible for converting standardized requests within the framework into the format required by the native API of the model and converting the model's response back into the framework's standard format, thus allowing developers to easily switch and integrate different LLMs.\n\n```go\ntype ModelProvider interface {\n    // Generate performs a complete generation request and returns the result at once. Suitable for scenarios where real-time feedback is not needed.\n    Generate(context.Context, *ModelRequest, ...ModelOption) (*ModelResponse, error)\n    // NewStream initiates a streaming request. This method immediately returns a Streamer object, through which the caller can receive the generated content from the model step by step, suitable for building real-time, typewriter-effect conversation applications.\n    NewStream(context.Context, *ModelRequest, ...ModelOption) (Streamer[*ModelResponse], error)\n}\n```\n![ModelProvider](./docs/images/model.png)\n\n### Agent\n`Agent` is the core or",

It is under active development and may experience breaking changes.\n\n[![status: community project](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-community_project-blue)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1531/community-projects)\n\n`tsidp` is an OIDC / OAuth Identity Provider (IdP) server that integrates with your Tailscale network. It allows you to use Tailscale identities for authentication into applications that support OpenID Connect as well as authenticated MCP client / server connections.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A Tailscale network (tailnet) with magicDNS and HTTPS enabled\n- A Tailscale authentication key from your tailnet\n- (Recommended) Docker installed on your system\n- Ability to set an Application capability grant\n\n## Running tsidp\n\n### (Recommended) Using the pre-built image\n\nDocker images are automatically published on when releases are tagged.\n\n```bash\n# to use the latest image\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/tailscale/tsidp:latest\n\n# to use a specific release version\n$ docker pull ghcr.io/tailscale/tsidp:v0.0.2\n```\n\nRunning a tsidp container:\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Replace `YOUR_TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY` with your Tailscale authentication key in the following commands:\n>\n> Use an existing auth key or create a new auth key in the [Tailscale dashboard](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys). Ensure you select an existing [tag](https://tailscale.com/kb/1068/tags) or create a new one.\n\n```bash\n# Run tsidp with a persistent volume to store state\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name tsidp \\\n  -p 443:443 \\\n  -v tsidp-data:/data \\\n  -e TAILSCALE_USE_WIP_CODE=1 \\\n  -e TS_STATE_DIR=/data \\\n  -e TS_HOSTNAME=idp \\\n  -e TSIDP_ENABLE_STS=1 \\\n  ghcr.io/tailscale/tsidp:latest\n```\n\nVisit `https://idp.yourtailnet.ts.net` to confirm the service is running.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're running tsidp for the first time it may take a few minutes for the TLS certificate to generate. You may not be able to access the service until the certificate is ready.\n\n### Other Ways to Build and Run\n\n<details>\n<summary>Building your own container</summary>\n\n```bash\n$ make docker-image\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Using Go directly</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to build tsidp and / or run it directly you can do the following:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the Tailscale repository\n$ git clone https://github.com/tailscale/tsidp.git\n$ cd tsidp\n\n# run with default values for flags\n$ TAILSCALE_USE_WIP_CODE=1 TS_AUTHKEY={YOUR_TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY} TSNET_FORCE_LOGIN=1 go run .\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Setting an Application Capability Grant\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Access to the admin UI and dynamic client registration endpoints are **denied** by default.\n\nTo access the admin UI and dynamic client registration endpoints an [Application capability grant](https://tailscale.com/kb/1537/grants-app-capabilities) must be set in the the [Tailscale console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/acls/).\n\nThis is a permissive grant that is suitable for testing purposes:\n\n```json\n\"grants\": [\n  {\n    \"src\": [\"*\"],\n    \"dst\": [\"*\"],\n    \"app\": {\n      \"tailscale.com/cap/tsidp\": [\n        {\n          // allow access to UI\n          \"allow_admin_ui\": true,\n\n          // allow dynamic client registration\n          \"allow_dcr\": true,\n\n          // Secure Token Service (STS) controls\n          \"users\":     [\"*\"],\n          \"resources\": [\"*\"],\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n],\n```\n\n## tsidp Configuration Options\n\nThe `tsidp-server` is configured by several command-line flags:\n\n| Flag                    | Description                                                                                        | Default  |\n| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| `-dir <path>`           | Directory path to save tsnet and tsidp state.

Encryption\n> 2. Encoding\n> 3. Output formatting\n\n**`-i / --input <path>`** [required]\n\nBinary input file.\n\n**`-f / --format <value>`** [optional, default: `raw`]\n\nOutput format of the processed data. This generates the final data as an array of bytes in the selected programming language. Output is always sent to STDOUT.\n\nTo avoid applying any formatting output, use the `raw` value (default).\n\nAvailable values: `raw`, `hex`, `c`, `go`, `powershell`, `php`, `js`, `rust`, `csharp`, `nim`, `zig`, `ruby`, `python`, `java`\n\n**`-x / --enc-alg <value>` + `-k / --enc-key <string>`** [optional]\n\nData encryption. Both parameters, the encryption algorithm and the key string, must be provided.\n\nAvailabe values: `xor`, `aes256`, `rc4`\n\nAll supported encryption algorithms are described in details below.\n\n**`-e / --encoding <value>`** [optional]\n\nData encoding. Often used as obfuscation to confuse analysis or changes in the entropy level of data.\n\nAvailable values: `base32`, `base64`, `ipv4`, `mac`\n\nAll supported encoding algorithms are described in details below.\n\n## Supported encryption algorithms\n\n#### **`xor`** [0% overhead]\n\nTypical simple XOR encryption (`a^b`). Each byte is XORed with the byte from the key.\n\n#### **`aes256`** [28 bytes overhead]\n\nAES-256-GCM with the 32-bytes long key derived from SHA-256 hash function.\n\nCiphertext format: `nonce || ciphertext`. Nonce is stored in the first 12 bytes, followed by the encrypted data and authentication tag (the tag is appended automatically by GCM inside ciphertext).\n\nStandard Go implementation of AES encryption:`crypto/aes`\nStandard Go implementation of SHA-256 key derivation: `crypto/sha256`\n\n#### **`rc4`** [0% overhead]\n\nStandard Go implementation of RC4 encryption: `crypto/rc4`\n\n## Supported encoding algorithms\n\n#### **`base32`** [60–65% overhead]\n\nStandard Go implementation of Base32 encoding: `encoding/base32`\n\n#### **`base64`** [33%-37% overhead]\n\nStandard Go implementation of Base64 encoding: `encoding/base64`\n\n#### **`ipv4`** [100%-300% overhead]\n\nThis is known as the _IPv4Fuscation_ technique. Each output byte is converted to one octet in the IPv4 address as a decimal number.\n\nExample data:\n\n```text\n{ 0xe9, 0x36, 0x17, 0xbb, 0xbd, 0x7f, 0x22, 0x10 }\n```\n\nThe output (array of bytes) looks exactly like this in memory:\n\n`233.54.23.187\\0189.127.34.16\\0` ...\n\n> NOTE:\n>\n> - Each IP address ends with a null byte!\n> - If the number of bytes is not divisible by 4, the missing bytes added to the last IP address are 255.\n\n#### **`mac`** [200% overhead]\n\nThis is known as the _MACFuscation_ technique. Each output byte is converted to one octet in the MAC address as a hexadecimal number (lowercase).\n\nExample data:\n\n```text\n{ 0xe9, 0x36, 0x17, 0xbb, 0xbd, 0x7f, 0x22, 0x10, 0x84, 0xA7, 0x6f, 0xcc }\n```\n\nThe output (array of bytes) looks exactly like this in memory:\n\n`e9:36:17:bb:bd:7f\\022:10:84:a7:6f:cc\\0`\n\n> NOTE:\n>\n> - Each MAC address ends with a null byte!\n> - Hexadecimal numbers are lowercase.\n> - If the number of bytes is not divisible by 6, the missing bytes added to the last MAC address are 255 (`ff`).\n\n## Credits\n\n- [HellShell](https://github.com/NUL0x4C/HellShell) - inspired me to implement _IPv4Fuscation_ and _MACFuscation_.\n\n## TODO\n\n- Add base32 encoding\n",

Takes care of all the hard parts. Passwords, email address verification, sessions, rate limiting, password resets, and more.\n2. Extends your existing user database instead of replacing it. Own and customize your user data. No more data synchronization between servers.\n3. No direct connections to your database.\n4. Only ephemeral data is stored. Less things to manage and worry about.\n\n```ts\nconst result = await client.createSignup(emailAddress);\nif (!result.ok) {\n    console.log(result.errorCode);\n    return;\n}\nconsole.log(result.signup);\nwindow.localStorage.setItem(\"signup_token\", result.signupToken);\n```\n\nThe package has no hard dependencies. All you need is a key-value store and an email server.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/faroedev/faroe\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tserver := faroe.NewServer(\n\t\tstorage,\n\t\tuserStore,\n\t\tlogger,\n\t\tuserPasswordHashAlgorithms,\n\t\ttemporaryPasswordHashAlgorithm,\n\t\tcpuCount,\n\t\tfaroe.RealClock,\n\t\tfaroe.AllowAllEmailAddresses,\n\t\temailSender,\n\t\tsessionConfig,\n\t)\n}\n```\n\nOnly password authentication is supported. Support for passkeys and 2FA are planned but there are no immediate plans to add social login (e.g. Sign in with Google).\n",

If no daemon is running, a friendly message is printed instead.\n\n### Stop the Daemon\n\n```bash\ntunn stop\n```\n\nThe stop command asks the daemon to shut down cleanly, waits for it to exit, and reports success.\n\n### Output Example\n\n```\nTunnels Ready\n\n[api]\n    3000 ➜ 3000 [active]\n    4000 ➜ 4001 [active]\n[db]\n    3306 ➜ 3306 [connecting]\n    5432 ➜ 5432 [active]\n```\n\n## SSH Configuration\n\n`tunn` uses your system's SSH configuration. Make sure your hosts are defined in `~/.ssh/config`:\n\n```ssh\nHost myserver\n    HostName 192.168.1.100\n    User myuser\n    Port 22\n\nHost database\n    HostName db.example.com\n    User dbuser\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/db_key\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Go 1.21 or higher (for building)\n- OpenSSH client (`ssh` command)\n- Valid SSH configuration\n- macOS and Linux are supported today; Windows support is planned but not available yet\n\n## Daemon Runtime Files\n\nWhile running in detached mode, `tunn` stores the following files in its runtime directory:\n\n- `daemon.pid` – PID of the active daemon; used to prevent duplicate launches.\n- `daemon.sock` – Unix domain socket for control commands (e.g., `tunn status`).\n- `daemon.log` – Aggregated stdout/stderr from the daemon process.\n\nThe directory is created with `0700` permissions, and files are cleaned up automatically when the daemon exits or when stale state is detected on the next launch.\n",

\"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC... user@hostname\"\n    - \"ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user2@hostname\"\n  authorized_keys_file: \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"  # 可选：从文件读取公钥\n\n# 自定义提示词配置\nprompt:\n  system_prompt: \"你是一个专业的AI助手，请用中文回答问题。\"\n  stdin_prompt: \"请分析以下内容并提供相关的帮助或建议：\"\n  exec_prompt: \"请回答以下问题或执行以下任务：\"\n\n# MCP工具配置\nmcp:\n  enabled: true  # 启用MCP功能\n  refresh_interval: 300  # 工具列表刷新间隔（秒）\n  servers:\n    # 使用uvx的稳定服务（推荐）\n    - name: \"time\"\n      transport: \"stdio\"\n      command: [\"uvx\", \"mcp-server-time\"]\n      enabled: true\n    - name: \"fetch\"\n      transport: \"stdio\"\n      command: [\"uvx\", \"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n      enabled: true\n    # 使用npx的服务（可能需要更长启动时间）\n    - name: \"bing\"\n      transport: \"stdio\"\n      command: [\"npx\", \"bing-cn-mcp\"]\n      enabled: true\n```\n\n### 3. 运行服务器\n\n```bash\n# 直接运行（使用默认配置文件 config.yaml）\n./sshai\n\n# 指定配置文件运行\n./sshai -c config.yaml\n./sshai -c /path/to/your/config.yaml\n\n# 后台运行\n./sshai > server.log 2>&1 &\n\n# 使用脚本运行\n./scripts/run.sh\n```\n\n#### 命令行参数\n\n- `-c <config_file>` - 指定配置文件路径\n  - 如果不指定，默认使用当前目录下的 `config.yaml`\n  - 如果配置文件不存在，程序会显示错误提示并退出\n\n```bash\n# 使用示例\n./sshai -c config.yaml          # 使用当前目录的配置文件\n./sshai -c /etc/sshai/config.yaml  # 使用绝对路径的配置文件\n./sshai                         # 默认使用 config.yaml\n```\n\n### 4. 连接使用\n\n```bash\n# 交互模式\nssh user@localhost -p 2213\n\n# 直接执行命令\nssh user@localhost -p 2213 \"你好，请介绍一下你自己\"\n\n# 管道输入分析\ncat file.txt | ssh user@localhost -p 2213\necho \"分析这段代码\" | ssh user@localhost -p 2213\n```\n\n## 📁 项目结构\n\n```\nsshai/\n├── README.md              # 中文说明文档\n├── README_EN.md           # 英文说明文档\n├── LICENSE                # 开源协议\n├── config.yaml           # 主配置文件\n├── config-en.yaml        # 英文配置文件\n├── go.mod                # Go模块依赖\n├── Makefile              # 构建脚本\n├── cmd/                  # 程序入口\n│   └── main.go           # 主程序文件\n├── pkg/                  # 核心模块\n│   ├── config/           # 配置管理\n│   ├── models/           # 数据模型\n│   ├── ai/               # AI助手功能\n│   ├── ssh/              # SSH服务器\n│   └── utils/            # 工具函数\n├── docs/                 # 项目文档\n├── scripts/              # 测试和运行脚本\n└── keys/                 # SSH密钥文件\n```\n\n## 🔧 配置指南\n\n### API配置\n\n支持多个API端点配置：\n\n```yaml\napi:\n  base_url: \"https://api.deepseek.com/v1\"\n  api_key: \"your-deepseek-key\"\n  default_model: \"deepseek-v3\"\n  timeout: 600\n\n# 可配置多个API\napi_endpoints:\n  - name: \"deepseek\"\n    base_url: \"https://api.deepseek.com/v1\"\n    api_key: \"your-key\"\n    default_model: \"deepseek-v3\"\n  - name: \"local\"\n    base_url: \"http://localhost:11434/v1\"\n    api_key: \"ollama\"\n    default_model: \"gemma2:27b\"\n```\n\n### 认证配置\n\n#### 密码认证\n```yaml\nauth:\n  password: \"your-secure-password\"  # 设置访问密码\n  login_prompt: \"请输入访问密码: \"\n```\n\n#### SSH公钥免密登录\n```yaml\nauth:\n  password: \"your-secure-password\"  # 必须设置密码才能启用SSH公钥认证\n  login_prompt: \"请输入访问密码: \"\n  # 方式一：直接配置公钥列表\n  authorized_keys:\n    - \"ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC... user@hostname\"\n    - \"ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... user2@hostname\"\n  # 方式二：从文件读取公钥\n  authorized_keys_file: \"~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n```\n\n**SSH公钥使用方法**：\n```bash\n# 生成SSH密钥对\nssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/sshai_key\n\n# 使用私钥连接（免密登录）\nssh -i ~/.ssh/sshai_key -p 2213 user@localhost\n\n# 查看公钥内容（用于配置）\ncat ~/.ssh/sshai_key.pub\n```\n\n**注意**: \n-",
