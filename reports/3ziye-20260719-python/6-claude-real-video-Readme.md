**Let Claude — or any LLM — actually watch a video.**

```bash
pip install "claude-real-video[whisper]"
npx skills add HUANGCHIHHUNGLeo/claude-real-video   # one command, installs the skill into Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI & 50+ agent hosts
```

Then paste a video link into your agent and ask about it. (CLI-only use? `crv "<url>"` works with just the pip install.)

> **Naming:** crv is the short name for claude-real-video (the PyPI package). The paid add-on, **crv Pro**, is sold on Capafy under the listing name "llm-real-video Pro".

> Same 58-second clip: fixed 1 fps sampling = **58 frames**. crv keeps the **26 that actually differ** — and `--grid` packs them into **3 contact sheets**. Fewer tokens, nothing missed.

> **This free version lets your AI *see* the video.** [crv Pro](https://leoaido.com/crv-pro/) lets it *understand* it — how it was shot (cut rhythm, camera moves) plus a timestamped timeline of what frames can't show: gestures, expressions, voice pitch shifts, emotion, sound events. One-time founder price $19 through July 31 ($29 from August 1) — [get it on Capafy](https://capafy.ai/agent/llm-real-video-pro-let-any-llm-watch-videos/5451082151) or [buy with card via Lemon Squeezy](https://leoaido.lemonsqueezy.com/checkout/buy/ff552000-adc0-49f1-8eec-5e8ada1905a1).

Most AI tools don't really *see* a video. Paste a YouTube link into ChatGPT and it
reads the **transcript**, not the picture. Claude won't take a video file at all.
Even Gemini, which *can* read video natively, has to send it up to Google and
samples frames at a **fixed interval** (1 fps by default), so fast cuts slip past.

`claude-real-video` does it differently, and **the processing runs locally**: point it at a URL or a
file, and it pulls the frames that *actually matter* (every scene change, not a
fixed quota), throws away the near-duplicates, transcribes the audio, and hands
you a clean folder any LLM can read. All the processing happens on your own machine — what gets sent anywhere is only the frames/text *you* choose to paste into an LLM afterwards.

```bash
crv "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."
# → crv-out/frames/*.jpg  +  frames.json (per-frame timestamps)  +  transcript.txt/.json  +  MANIFEST.txt
```

Then drop the frames + `MANIFEST.txt` into Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini and ask away.

**No terminal needed** — run `crv-web` and a local page opens (Traditional Chinese / Simplified Chinese / English): paste a YouTube or Reels link or a file path, click Analyze, open the result viewer. Video analysis and output generation run on your machine — the source video never gets uploaded. (If you then paste the extracted frames or transcript into a cloud LLM, that data goes to that provider.)

Want to eyeball what the model will see first? Add `--viewer` — it writes a local `viewer.html` (video + keyframe grid + transcript) you can double-click open. No network, no extra installs.

**Slow-changing content** (animation tutorials, gradual morphs, slow pans): add `--adaptive` — frames are picked against their rolling neighbourhood instead of a fixed threshold, so a 2-3s squash-and-stretch that never spikes any single frame still gets captured.

**Text-heavy content** (lecture slides, screen recordings, talking-head explainers): add `--text-anchors` — extra frames are forced at subtitle-cue timestamps, so each spoken segment gets a matching visual even when the scene barely changes. Needs a sidecar `.srt`/`.vtt` or an embedded subtitle track — captions burned into the pixels can't be detected. At most one forced frame per second; scene detection is untouched.

**Multi-speaker content** (interviews, podcasts, meetings): add `--speakers` — every transcript line gets a speaker label (`[SPEAKER_00]`, `[SPEAKER_01]`, …) so the model can follow who said what. Runs a local diarization model (45 MB, downloads once, no account or token needed). Install with `pip install "claude-real-video[speakers]"`.

Not doing LLM work? It also works as a **general-purpose video keyframe extractor** —
scene-change detection + dedup, no ML models to download.

**Using Claude Code — or any coding agent?** One command installs the skill
(works with Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI and other
[agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)-compatible hosts):

```bash
pip install "claude-real-video[whisper]"
npx skills add HUANGCHIHHUNGLeo/claude-real-video
```

Then just paste a video link into your agent and ask about it.
