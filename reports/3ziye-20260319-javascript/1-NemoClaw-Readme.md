NVIDIA NemoClaw is an open source stack that simplifies running [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) always-on assistants safely. It installs the [NVIDIA OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) runtime, part of [NVIDIA Agent Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest), a secure environment for running autonomous agents, with inference routed through [NVIDIA cloud](https://build.nvidia.com).

> **Alpha software**
> 
> NemoClaw is early-stage. Expect rough edges. We are building toward production-ready sandbox orchestration, but the starting point is getting your own environment up and running.
> Interfaces, APIs, and behavior may change without notice as we iterate on the design.
> The project is shared to gather feedback and enable early experimentation, but it
> should not yet be considered production-ready.
> We welcome issues and discussion from the community while the project evolves.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with NemoClaw and your first sandboxed OpenClaw agent.

> [!NOTE]
> NemoClaw creates a fresh OpenClaw instance inside the sandbox during onboarding.

### Prerequisites

Check the prerequisites before you start to ensure you have the necessary software and hardware to run NemoClaw.

#### Hardware

| Resource | Minimum        | Recommended      |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| CPU      | 4 vCPU         | 4+ vCPU          |
| RAM      | 8 GB           | 16 GB            |
| Disk     | 20 GB free     | 40 GB free       |

The sandbox image is approximately 2.4 GB compressed. During image push, the Docker daemon, k3s, and the OpenShell gateway run alongside the export pipeline, which buffers decompressed layers in memory. On machines with less than 8 GB of RAM, this combined usage can trigger the OOM killer. If you cannot add memory, configuring at least 8 GB of swap can work around the issue at the cost of slower performance.

#### Software

| Dependency | Version                          |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| Linux      | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later |
| Node.js    | 20 or later |
| npm        | 10 or later |
| Container runtime | Supported runtime installed and running |
| [OpenShell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell) | Installed |

#### Container Runtime Support

| Platform | Supported runtimes | Notes |
|----------|--------------------|-------|
| Linux | Docker | Primary supported path today |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | Colima, Docker Desktop | Recommended runtimes for supported macOS setups |
| macOS | Podman | Not supported yet. NemoClaw currently depends on OpenShell support for Podman on macOS. |
| Windows WSL | Docker Desktop (WSL backend) | Supported target path |

> [!TIP]
> For DGX Spark, follow the [DGX Spark setup guide](spark-install.md). It covers Spark-specific prerequisites, such as cgroup v2 and Docker configuration, before running the standard installer.

### Install NemoClaw and Onboard OpenClaw Agent

Download and run the installer script.
The script installs Node.js if it is not already present, then runs the guided onboard wizard to create a sandbox, configure inference, and apply security policies.

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | bash
```

If you use nvm or fnm to manage Node.js, the installer may not update your current shell's PATH.
If `nemoclaw` is not found after install, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` for zsh) or open a new terminal.

When the install completes, a summary confirms the running environment:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Sandbox      my-assistant (Landlock + seccomp + netns)
Model        nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b (NVIDIA Cloud API)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
Run:         nemoclaw my-assistant connect
Status:      nemoclaw my-assistant status
Logs:        nemoclaw my-assistant logs --follow
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

[INFO]  === Installation complete ===
```

### Chat with the Agent

Connect to the sandbox, then chat with the agent through the TUI or the CLI.

```console
$ nemoclaw my-assistant connect
```

#### OpenClaw TUI

The OpenClaw TUI opens an interactive chat interface. Type a message and press Enter to send it to the agent:

```console
sandbox@my-assistant:~$ openclaw tui
```

Send a test message to the agent and verify you receive a response.

> [!NOTE]
> The TUI is best for interactive back-and-
