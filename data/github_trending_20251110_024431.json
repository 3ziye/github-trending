We're calling this a beta because our tools and documentation need more battle testing in the open source world. Valdi will exit beta when we're happy with the developer experience.\n\n**Valdi is a cross-platform UI framework that delivers native performance without sacrificing developer velocity.** Write your UI once in declarative TypeScript, and it compiles directly to native views on iOS, Android, and macOS—no web views, no JavaScript bridges. \n\n## Quick Example\n\nA basic Valdi component:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Component } from 'valdi_core/src/Component';\n\nclass HelloWorld extends Component {\n  onRender() {\n    const message = 'Hello World! 👻';\n    <view backgroundColor='#FFFC00' padding={30}>\n      <label color='black' value={message} />\n    </view>;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./docs/docs/assets/start-about/IMG_1445.jpg\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Hello World example running on iOS\" />\n</p>\n\n## Quick Links\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](./docs/INSTALL.md)\n- [Documentation](./docs/README.md)\n- [Codelabs](./docs/docs/start-code-lab.md)\n- [API Reference](./docs/api/api-quick-reference.md)\n- [Component Library (Coming Soon!)](https://github.com/Snapchat/Valdi_Widgets)\n\n## Why Choose Valdi?\n\nValdi is a cross-platform UI framework designed to solve the fundamental problem of cross-platform development: velocity vs. runtime performance. For 8 years, it has powered a large portion of Snap's production apps.\n\n### True Native Performance\n\nUnlike frameworks that rely on web views or JavaScript bridges, Valdi compiles declaratively rendered TypeScript components into platform-native views. Valdi also includes several other performance advantages:\n\n- **[Automatic view recycling](./docs/docs/performance-view-recycling.md)** - Global view pooling system reuses native views across all screens, dramatically reducing inflation latency\n- **Optimized component rendering** - Components re-render independently without triggering parent re-renders, enabling fast incremental updates\n- **Optimized layout engine** - C++ layout engine runs on the main thread with minimal marshalling overhead\n- **Viewport-aware rendering** - Only visible views are inflated, making infinite scrolling performant by default\n\nLearn more in our [Performance Optimization Guide](./docs/docs/performance-optimization.md).\n\n### Developer Experience Built for Speed\n\nValdi eliminates the traditional compile-test-debug cycle that slows native development:\n\n- **Instant hot reload** - See changes in milliseconds on iOS, Android, or desktop without recompiling\n- **[Full VSCode debugging](./docs/docs/workflow-hermes-debugger.md)** - Set breakpoints, inspect variables, profile performance, and capture heap dumps directly in VSCode\n- **Familiar syntax** - TSX components with TypeScript for type safety\n\n### Flexible Adoption Model\n\nValdi integrates easily into existing apps - start small and scale as needed:\n\n- **[Embed Valdi in native](./docs/docs/native-bindings.md)** - Drop Valdi components into existing UIKit or Android view hierarchies\n- **[Embed native in Valdi](./docs/docs/native-customviews.md)** - Use platform-specific views within Valdi layouts via `<custom-view>`\n- **[Polyglot modules](./docs/docs/native-polyglot.md)** - Write performance-critical code in C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Objective-C with type-safe bindings to TypeScript\n- **[Full-stack architecture](./docs/docs/advanced-full-stack.md)** - Build entire features in Valdi with worker threads for background processing, eliminating platform-specific bridge code\n\n### Deep Native Integration\n\nValdi generates type-safe bindings between TypeScript and native platforms:\n\n- **[Automatic code generation](./docs/docs/native-annotations.md)** - TypeScript interfaces compile to Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift bindings\n- **[Native API access](./docs/docs/native-polyglot.md)** - Direct access to platform APIs and third-party native libraries through polyglot modules\n- **Bidirectional communication** - Pass complex data structures and callbacks between TypeScript and native code safely\n- **[Native protobuf support](./docs/docs/advanced-protobuf.md)** - Seamless integration with protobuf for efficient data ser",

[(docs)](#initialize-the-godot-instance)\n* When restarting, the engine can be reconfigured, so a different Godot app may be loaded each time. [(docs)](#stop-the-godot-instance)\n* It is also possible to pause and resume the running Godot instance. [(docs)](#pause-the-godot-instance)\n* Godot is running on a separate thread, so it does not affect the main thread of the application nor the React Native JavaScript thread. [(docs)](#threading-and-javascript-in-react-native)\n* The Godot main window and any subwindows created by the Godot app may be embedded into the React Native application either on the same screen, or on separate screens (see [example app](example/)).\n* The whole Godot API is accessible from TypeScript / JavaScript. It is possible to instantiate objects, call methods, get and set properties, attach JS functions to signals, provide JS functions as callables to Godot methods ... etc. [(docs)](#godot-api-usage)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33266f05-d733-4c1d-ab49-edaaf426e3e1\" width=\"600\" controls></video>\n</p>\n\n# Getting Started with the Example App\n\nThe [example app](example/) shows the main features of React Native Godot in action.\n\n## Install Prerequisites\n\nDuring development we use [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage most external dependencies required for React Native development, like Node, Java, Gradle or Ruby. If you also use ASDF, just run:\n\n```sh\nasdf install\n```\n    \nThis will make sure that all the dependencies are the same like in our environment. Otherwise you may also install React Native prerequisites using any other method.\n\n## Export the Godot app\n\nRun the following scripts for either platform you plan to test (or both):\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest.sh ios\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh android\n./export_godot_GodotTest2.sh ios\n```\n\nThe script is configured to look for Godot in the standard system wide installation folder on macOS. If your Godot is installed elsewhere, or you are on Linux, just point the `GODOT_EDITOR`\nenvironment variable to your Godot editor prior to running the above scripts:\n\n```sh\nexport GODOT_EDITOR=/path/to/godot_editor\n```\n\n## Configure and download LibGodot\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThese commands will resolve all the React Native and other dependencies from npm. The second one will download the prebuilt LibGodot release from GitHub.\n\n## Run on the iOS Simulator\n\n```sh\ncd example/ios\nbundle install\nbundle exec pod install\ncd ..\nyarn ios\n```\n\n## Run on the Android Emulator\n\n```sh\ncd example\nyarn android\n```\n\n## Use your native IDEs\n\nYou may use Xcode and Android Studio the same way as with any other project. Just open:\n\n* ``ios/GodotTest.xcworkspace`` from Xcode\n* ``android`` from Android Studio\n\n> [!note]\n> If you are using ASDF to manage your Java and Node dependencies, you should start Android Studio from under the `react-native-godot` (or `example`) folder, so it can find these tools. For example on macOS:\n\n```sh\ncd example\nopen -a \"Android Studio\"\n```\n\n## Convenience script for dependency management\n\nThere is an `update_deps.sh` script included in the example app's folder. It will execute all the setup commands for both iOS and Android in one step, so you may start your work immediately.\n\n```sh\ncd example\n./update_deps.sh\nyarn ios # or yarn android\n```\n\n# Your first React Native Godot App\n\nBorn React Native Godot is distributed on npm.\n\nJust follow these steps to add it to your React Native application:\n\n## Update `package.json`\n\n```sh\nyarn add @borndotcom/react-native-godot\n```\n\n## Download the prebuilt LibGodot packages\n\nThe LibGodot packages used by React Native Godot are not distributed on npm. Instead, they are downloaded separately by issuing the following command:\n\n```sh\nyarn download-prebuilt\n```\n\nThis way React Native Godot can be updated independently from LibGodot, and also local, customized builds of LibGodot are supported.\n\n## Import React Native Godot in your App code\n\n```typescript\nimport { RTNGodot, RTNGodotView, runOnGodotThread } from \"@borndotcom/react-native-godot\";\n```\n\n## Add the Godot View to your view, e.g.\n\n```tsx\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <View>\n      <RTNGodotView style={...}/>\n    </View>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIf no `windowName` property is specified, that view is fo",

[done] Complete 3D Lidar SLAM, fast LIO front-end (AA-FasterLIO), standard\n2. [done] 3D to 2D map conversion (g2p5), optional, if selected outputs real-time 2D grid map, can be saved\n3. [done] Real-time loop closure detection, standard, performs back-end loop closure detection and correction if selected\n4. [done] Smooth high-precision 3D Lidar localization, standard\n5. [done] Dynamic loading scheme for map partitions, suitable for large-scale scenes\n6. [done] Localization with separate dynamic and static layers, adaptable to dynamic scenes, selectable strategies for dynamic layer, optional, if selected saves dynamic layer map content, three strategies available (short-term, medium-term, permanent), default is permanent\n7. [done] High-frequency IMU smooth output, standard, 100Hz\n8. GPS geoinformation association, optional (TODO)\n9. Vehicle odometry input, optional (TODO)\n10. [done] Lightweight optimization library miao and incremental optimization (derived from g2o, but lighter and faster, supports incremental optimization, no need to rebuild optimization model), standard, used in both loop closure and localization\n11. [done] Two verification schemes: offline and online. Offline allows breakpoint debugging with strong consistency. Online allows multi-threaded concurrency, fast processing speed, dynamic frame skipping, and low resource usage.\n12. [done] High-frequency output based on extrapolator and smoother, adjustable smoothing factor\n13. [done] High-performance computing: All the above features can run using less than one CPU core on the pure CPU side (online localization 0.8 cores, mapping 1.2 cores, 32-line LiDAR, without UI).\n\n## Examples\n\n- Mapping on the VBR campus dataset:\n\n![](./doc/slam_vbr.gif)\n\n- Localization on VBR\n\n![](./doc/lm_loc_vbr_campus.gif)\n\n- Map on VBR\n   - Point Cloud\n\n  ![](./doc/campus_vbr.png)\n   - Grid Map\n\n  ![](./doc/campus.png)\n\n- Localization on the NCLT dataset\n\n![](./doc/lm_loc1_nclt.gif)\n\n## Build\n\n### Environment\n\nUbuntu 22.04 or higher.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 should also work, but not tested.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- ros2 humble or above\n- Pangolin (for visualization, see thirdparty)\n- OpenCV\n- PCL\n- yaml-cpp\n- glog\n- gflags\n- pcl_conversions\n\nOn Ubuntu 22.04, run: ```bash ./scripts/install_dep.sh```.\n\n### Build\n\nBuild this package with ```colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release```.\n\nThen ```source install/setup.bash``` to use it.\n\n### Build Results\n\nAfter building, you will get the corresponding online/offline mapping and localization programs for this package. The offline programs are suitable for scenarios with offline data packets to quickly obtain mapping/localization results, while the online programs are suitable for scenarios with actual sensors to obtain real-time results.\n\nFor example, calling the offline mapping program on the NCLT dataset:\n```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --input_bag ~/data/NCLT/20130110/20130110.db3 --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n\nIf you want to call the online version, just change the offline part to online.\n\n## Testing on Datasets\n\nYou can directly use our converted datasets. If you need the original datasets, you need to convert them to the ros2 db3 format.\n\nConverted dataset addresses:\n- OneDrive: https://1drv.ms/f/c/1a7361d22c554503/EpDSys0bWbxDhNGDYL_O0hUBa2OnhNRvNo2Gey2id7QMQA?e=7Ui0f5\n- BaiduYun: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NEGQcYoMtd57oqog09pB6w?pwd=5v8h 提取码: 5v8h \n\nOriginal dataset addresses:\n\n- NCLT dataset: http://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/\n- UrbanLoco dataset: https://github.com/weisongwen/UrbanLoco\n- VBR dataset: https://www.rvp-group.net/slam-dataset.html\n\n### Mapping Test\n\n1. Real-time mapping (real-time bag playback)\n   - Start the mapping program:\n     ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_online --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml```\n   - Play the data bag\n   - Save the map ```ros2 service call /lightning/save_map /lightning/srv/SaveMap \"{map_id: new_map}\"```\n2. Offline mapping (traverse data, faster)\n   - ```ros2 run lightning run_slam_offline --config ./config/default_nclt.yaml --input_bag [bag_file]```\n   - It will automatically save to the data/new_map directory after finishing.\n3. Viewing the map\n   - View the full map: ```pcl_viewer ./data/new_map/global.pcd```\n   - The actual map is stored in blocks, global.pcd is only for displaying the result.\n   - map.pgm stores the 2D grid map information.\n   - Note that during the localization program run or upon exit, results for dynamic layers might also be stored in the same directory, so there might be more files.\n\n### Localization Test\n\n1. Real-time localization\n   - Write the map path to `system.map_path` in the yaml file, default is `new_map` (consistent with the mapping default).\n   - Place the vehicle at the mapping starting point.\n   - Start the localization program:\n     ```ros2 run lightning run_loc_on",

      "readme": "# DOSBox Pure Unleashed\nDOSBox Pure is a fork of [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/),\nan emulator for DOS games, aiming for simplicity and ease of use.\nThis project is a standalone version for desktop platforms of the [libretro core](../dosbox-pure).\n\n![Logo](images/logo.png)\n\n## Download\nYou can download the latest version of DOSBox Pure on [itch.io](https://schelling.itch.io/dosbox-pure) or from the [Releases page here](https://github.com/schellingb/dosbox-pure-unleashed/releases/latest).\n\nJust extract the ZIP file and then run DOSBoxPure.exe.\n\nOn macOS if you get an error that the program is damaged or otherwise can't be run, you need to open the Terminal app and execute this command to allow it to be executed:\n```sh\nxattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/DOSBoxPure.app\n```\n### Donations\nTips and donations are welcome, either through the [itch.io page](https://schelling.itch.io/dosbox-pure)\nor the Sponsor button at the top of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/schellingb/dosbox-pure-unleashed).\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\n## Loading Content\nDOSBox Pure can load ZIP files, CD images (ISO or CUE), floppy/hard disk images (IMG/IMA/VHD/JRC), DOS executable files (EXE/BAT/COM),\nlegacy DOSBox .conf files or folders directly. It also loads .DOSZ files which are just .ZIP files with a different extension.\n\nThere are 3 ways to load content. After startup, you can use the \"Load Content\" menu option to navigate to the file you want to load.\nAlternatively you can drag & drop a supported file onto the program window (after starting) or onto the program's icon (before starting).\n\n## Hotkeys\nA few system functions are bound to various F-keys, accessible while holding the hotkey modifier which by default is the Control key.\nThe hotkey modifier can be changed in the [System Settings](#system-settings). These are the hotkeys:\n\n| Key | Description                                     |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------|\n| F1  | Pause/Resume (F12 to step a frame while paused) |\n| F2  | Slow Motion                                     |\n| F3  | Fast Forward                                    |\n| F5  | Save State Quick Save                           |\n| F7  | Switch Full Screen and Windowed Mode            |\n| F9  | Save State Quick Load                           |\n| F11 | Lock Mouse to Window                            |\n| F12 | Toggle On-Screen Menu                           |\n\nUse the `General > Fast Forward/Slow Motion Mode` setting to swap between holding or toggling mode.\n\nIn addition, you can set the `General > Middle Mouse Button Open Menu` setting for easier access to the menu.\n\n## Features\n\n### Load Games from ZIP\nDOSBox Pure can load games directly from ZIP files without the need to extract them.\n\n### Store Modifications in Separate Save File\nChanges made to a loaded ZIP file will be stored as a separate ZIP file into the saves directory.  \nIf a game is loaded directly without using a container like ZIP or ISO the saves directory is not used.\n\n### Mount Disk Images from Inside ZIP Files\nCD images (ISO or CUE) and floppy disk images (IMG/IMA/VHD/JRC) can be mounted directly from inside ZIP files.  \nThe system will automatically mount the first found disk image as the A: or D: drive.  \nAdditional disks can be loaded or swapped by using the [start menu](#start-menu).\n\n### Start Menu\n![Start Menu](images/startmenu.png)\n\nThis is the first screen that appears after loading a game. It offers a gamepad controllable list\nwith all executable files of the loaded game. In addition it can load new content and swap which floppy disk or CD is inserted.\n\nBy using the tabs at the bottom, you can view the [Gamepad Mapper](#gamepad-mapper), the [System Settings](#system-settings)\nand while a game is running access the [On-Screen Keyboard](#on-screen-keyboard).\n\nWhile a game is running, you can open the menu again by pressing CTRL+F12 or L3 on the gamepad (usually by pushing in the left analog stick).\nThe keyboard hotkey can be modified in the [System Settings](#system-settings) and the gamepad button can be changed in the [Gamepad Mapper](#gamepad-mapper).\n\n### System Settings\nBy switching to the SYSTEM tab in the [start menu](#start-menu) you will find all program and emulation settings divided into various categories.\nEach setting has a list of options and a detailed description next to it.\n\n### Auto Start\nWhile in the [start menu](#start-menu), you can press right to set an item as the default which will skip the menu the next time the same content is loaded.\nBy pressing right multiple times, a number of frames can be specified that will automatically be skipped on start.\nThis can be used to skip over loading screens or start-up sequences.  \nIf there is only a single choice, the menu will not show and directly run the only executable file.\n\n### On-Screen Keyboard\n![On-Screen Keyboard](images/onscreenkeyboard.png)\n\nBy pressing L3 on the gamepad (usually by pushing in the left analog stick) t",

This provides\nboth the high level collectives API as well as several out of the box backends.\n\n* [Documentation](https://meta-pytorch.org/torchcomms/main/index.html)\n* [Examples](./comms/torchcomms/examples)\n\n## Prerequisites\n\ntorchcomms requires the following software and hardware:\n\n- Python 3.10 or higher\n- PyTorch 2.8 or higher\n- CUDA-capable GPU (for NCCL/NCCLX or RCCL backends)\n\n## Installation\n\ntorchcomms is available on PyPI and can be installed using pip. Alternatively,\nyou can build torchcomms from source.\n\n### Using pip (Nightly Builds)\n\nYou can install torchcomms and PyTorch nightly builds using pip:\n\n```bash\n# Cuda 12.6\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu126\n\n# Cuda 12.8\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu128\n\n# Cuda 12.9\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu129\n\n# Cuda 13.0\npip install --pre torch torchcomms --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130\n```\n\n### Building from Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- CMake 3.22 or higher\n- Ninja 1.10 or higher\n\nAlternatively, you can build torchcomms from source. If you want to build the NCCLX backend, we recommend building it under a virtual conda environment.\nRun the following commands to build and install torchcomms:\n\n```bash\n# Create a conda environment\nconda create -n torchcomms python=3.10\nconda activate torchcomms\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone git@github.com:meta-pytorch/torchcomms.git\ncd torchcomms\n```\n\n#### Build the backend (choose one based on your hardware):\n\n##### Standard NCCL Backend\n\nNo build needed - uses the library provided by PyTorch\n\n##### NCCLX Backend\n\nIf you want to install the third-party dependencies directly from conda, run the following command:\n```bash\nUSE_SYSTEM_LIBS=1 ./build_ncclx.sh\n```\n\nIf you want to build and install the third-party dependencies from source, run the following command:\n```bash\n./build_ncclx.sh\n```\n\n##### RCCL Backend\n\nInstall some prerequisites\n```\nconda install conda-forge::glog=0.4.0 conda-forge::gflags conda-forge::fmt -y\n```\n\nEnvironment variables to find rocm/rccl headers\n```\nexport ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm\nexport RCCL_INCLUDE=$ROCM_HOME/include/rccl\n```\n\n```bash\n./build_rccl.sh\n```\n\n#### Install torchcomms:\n\n```bash\n# Install PyTorch (if not already installed)\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation -v .\n```\n\n### Build Configuration\n\nYou can customize the build by setting environment variables before running pip install:\n\n```bash\n# Enable/disable specific backends (ON/OFF or 1/0)\nexport USE_NCCL=ON    # Default: ON\nexport USE_NCCLX=ON   # Default: ON\nexport USE_GLOO=ON    # Default: ON\nexport USE_RCCL=OFF   # Default: OFF\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\n# Install PyTorch (if not already installed)\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --no-build-isolation -v .\n```\n\n## Quick Start Example\n\nHere's a simple example demonstrating synchronous `AllReduce` communication across multiple GPUs:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# example.py\nimport torch\nfrom torchcomms import new_comm, ReduceOp\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize TorchComm with NCCLX backend\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\")\n    torchcomm = new_comm(\"nccl\", device, name=\"main_comm\")\n\n    # Get rank and world size\n    rank = torchcomm.get_rank()\n    world_size = torchcomm.get_size()\n\n    # Calculate device ID\n    num_devices = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    device_id = rank % num_devices\n    target_device = torch.device(f\"cuda:{device_id}\")\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}/{world_size}: Running on device {device_id}\")\n\n    # Create a tensor with rank-specific data\n    tensor = torch.full(\n        (1024,),\n        float(rank + 1),\n        dtype=torch.float32,\n        device=target_device\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}: Before AllReduce: {tensor[0].item()}\")\n\n    # Perform synchronous AllReduce (sum across all ranks)\n    torchcomm.all_reduce(tensor, ReduceOp.SUM, async_op=False)\n\n    # Synchronize CUDA stream\n    torch.cuda.current_stream().synchronize()\n\n    print(f\"Rank {rank}: After AllReduce: {tensor[0].item()}\")\n\n    # Cleanup\n    torchcomm.finalize()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Running the Example\n\nTo run this example with multiple processes (one per GPU):\n\n```bash\n# Using torchrun (recommended)\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=2 example.py\n\n# Or using python -m torch.distributed.launch\npython -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 example.py\n```\n\nTo run this example with multiple nodes:\n\n- Node 0\n```bash\ntorchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc_per_node=8 --node_rank=0 --rdzv-endpoint=\"<master-node>:<master-port>\" example.py\n```\n- Node 1\n```bash\ntorchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc_per_node=8 --node_ran",

      "readme": "# InlineExcuteEx\nBeacon Object Files (BOFs) in the Cobalt Strike ecosystem are intended to be an abstraction of [Position Independent Code (PIC)](https://aff-wg.org/). To maximize\nthe benefits of this, Cobalt Strike pre-processes BOFs to strip away sections that are not needed to achieve code execution. This design\nconfers some advantages for users of the framework. It reduces the size of the BOF that Beacon receives from the Teamserver, and the BOF \nloader in Beacon is very small compared to other BOF implementations. Unfortunately, this pre-processing has the inadvertent effect of\nreducing the features available from a BOF because the additional information is not available to Beacon at load-time. `InlineExcuteEx`\nimplements [COFFLoader](https://github.com/trustedsec/COFFLoader) as a Cobalt Strike compatible BOF, which can be used to fire other BOFs\nin a more complete way than what is currently possible from Beacon.\n\nThe obvious trade here is that you lose the approximate lightness of PIC offered by Beacon's BOF loader, in favor of a heavier abstraction. This is a nuance that may or may not be relevant to your use case. The intent of this implementation is to offer users of the framework a *choice*.\n\n## Basic Usage\nLoad `inline-execute-ex.cna` from the `Script Manager`. This will make the `inline-execute-ex` command available to you.\n\n```\nBOF+\n====\n[EXPERIMENTAL] BOF Loader.\n\n\t[EXPERIMENTAL] I heard you like BOFs. So I put a BOF in your BOF.\n```\n\nYou can use the `help inline-execute-ex` command to get some usage information from the command line.\n\n```\nbeacon> help inline-execute-ex\n# 1 - a string containing the BOF file\n# 2 - the entry point to call\n# 3 - arguments to pass to the BOF file\n\nUsage: inline-execute-ex 'bof.o' 'go' 'hello world!'\n```\n\n## Drop-In Replacement for `beacon_inline_execute`\nConventional `.cna` scripts register an alias that calls `beacon_inline_execute` to task Beacon to run a BOF. If you want to use `InlineExecuteEx` instead of the default BOF loader for a capability, you can move the `inline-execute-ex.cna` script, the `Release` directory, and the `x64` directory to the same directory as your BOF's `.cna` script.\n\n```sh\n    Directory: C:\\CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF\\SA\n\n\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\n[...snip...]\nd-----        10/15/2025   4:28 PM                Release\nd-----        10/15/2025   4:28 PM                x64\n-a----        10/15/2025   4:42 PM           2153 inline-execute-ex.cna\n-a----        10/15/2025   4:31 PM          45298 SA.cna\n```\n\nThen include the `inline-execute-ex.cna` in your BOF's cna script.\n```perl\n# SA.cna\ninclude(getFileProper(script_resource(\"inline-execute-ex.cna\"))); # This is the line you want to add\n\n%recordmapping = %(\nA => 1,\nNS => 2,\nMD => 3,\nMF => 4,\n[...snip...]\n```\n\nLastly, replace calls to `beacon_inline_execute` with `beacon_inline_execute_ex`.\n```perl\nalias dir {\n\tlocal('$params $keys $args $targetdir $subdirs $ttp $text');\n\n[...snip...]\n\n    # We changed the line below\n\tbeacon_inline_execute_ex($1, readbof($1, \"dir\", $msg, $ttp), \"go\", $args);\n}\n```\nThen reload your `.cna` in the `Script Manager`. If all goes well, you should see this when you run the alias.\n```sh\n[10/15 16:36:25] beacon> dir\n[10/15 16:36:25] [+] Running dir (T1083)\n[10/15 16:36:25] [*] Running dir (T1083)\n[10/15 16:36:25] [*] Running InlineExecuteEx. # <----- It works!\n[10/15 16:36:26] [+] host called home, sent: 23152 bytes\n[10/15 16:36:26] [+] received output:\nContents of .\\*:\n\t10/15/2025 16:25           <dir> .\n\t09/07/2025 15:20           <dir> ..\n\t10/12/2025 12:00          575216 beacon_x64.exe\n[...snip...]\n\t                        66840774 Total File Size for 2 File(s)\n\t                                                      8 Dir(s)\n\n[10/15 16:36:26] [+] received output:\n[+] Success!\n\n```\n\n## Beacon Object File Visual Studio Template\n\nSee the [BOF-VS](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/bof-vs) repository for more information about the template behind this BOF.",

This is the native format used by `NtCreateUserProcess` and bypasses some Win32 path parsing mechanisms.\n\n## Shellcode Execution Methods\n\n### 1. Direct RIP Hijacking\n```\nOriginal State:          Modified State:\n┌──────────────┐        ┌──────────────┐\n│ RIP: ntdll   │   →    │ RIP: 0x7FFE  │ (shellcode)\n│ RAX: ...     │        │ RAX: ...     │\n└──────────────┘        └──────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Simple and reliable.  \n**Detection Risk**: High - RIP directly pointing to non-module memory is easily detected by EDR thread scanning.\n\n### 2. JMP RAX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE0)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE0    │    →        │ RAX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: RIP points to legitimate ntdll.dll, more stealthy than direct hijacking.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Suspicious RAX value and unusual gadget execution may trigger heuristics.\n\n### 3. JMP RBX Gadget\n```\nStep 1: Find Gadget               Step 2: Set Context\n┌──────────────────┐             ┌──────────────────┐\n│ Scan ntdll.dll   │             │ RIP: ntdll!gadget│ (0xFF 0xE3)\n│ for 0xFF 0xE3    │    →        │ RBX: shellcode   │\n└──────────────────┘             └──────────────────┘\n```\n**Advantage**: Similar to JMP RAX, RIP remains in legitimate module space.  \n**Detection Risk**: Medium - Same as JMP RAX, slightly different register makes detection signatures less common.\n\n### 4. Callback Function Hijacking\n```\nEnumResourceTypesW(hModule, lpEnumFunc, lParam)\n                              ↓\n                    RCX = NULL\n                    RDX = shellcode address\n                    R8  = NULL\n```\n**Advantage**: Leverages legitimate callback mechanism, appears as normal Windows API usage.  \n**Detection",

This project uses [RT64](https://github.com/rt64/rt64) as the rendering engine to provide some of these enhancements.\n\n### [Check out the latest release here](https://github.com/sonicdcer/DNZHRecomp/releases/latest).\n\nJoin the [N64: Recompiled Community Discord](https://discord.gg/AWZThJ4dPf) to discuss this and other N64: Recompiled projects!\n\n[![Discord Invitation](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/1374083583739826328/widget.png?style=banner2 'N64 Recomp')](https://discord.gg/AWZThJ4dPf)\n\n### **This repository and its releases do not contain game assets. The original game is required to build or run this project.**\n\n## Table of Contents\n* [System Requirements](#system-requirements)\n* [Features](#features)\n  * [Plug and Play](#plug-and-play)\n  * [Fully Intact N64 Effects](#fully-intact-n64-effects)\n  * [Easy-to-Use Menus](#easy-to-use-menus)\n  * [High Framerate Support](#high-framerate-support)\n  * [Widescreen and Ultrawide Support](#widescreen-and-ultrawide-support)\n  * [Low Input Lag](#low-input-lag)\n  * [Linux and Steam Deck Support](#linux-and-steam-deck-support)\n* [Planned Features](#planned-features)\n* [FAQ](#faq)\n* [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n* [Building](#building)\n* [Libraries Used and Projects Referenced](#libraries-used-and-projects-referenced)\n\n## System Requirements\nA GPU supporting Direct3D 12.0 (Shader Model 6), Vulkan 1.2, or Metal Argument Buffers Tier 2 support is required to run this project. The oldest GPUs that should be supported for each vendor are:\n* GeForce GT 630\n* Radeon HD 7750 (the one from 2012, not to be confused with the RX 7000 series) and newer\n* Intel HD 510 (Skylake)\n* A Mac with Apple Silicon or an Intel 7th Gen CPU with MacOS 13.0+\n\nOn x86-64 PCs, a CPU supporting the SSE4.1 instruction set is also required (Intel Core 2 Penryn series or AMD Bulldozer and newer). ARM64 builds will work on any ARM64 CPU.\n\nIf you have issues with crashes on startup, make sure your graphics drivers are fully up to date. \n\n## Features\n\n#### Plug and Play\nSimply provide your copy of the North American version of the game in the main menu and start playing! This project will automatically load assets from the provided copy, so there is no need to go through a separate extraction step or build the game yourself.\n\n#### Fully Intact N64 Effects\nA lot of care was put into RT64 to make sure all graphical effects were rendered exactly as they did originally on the N64. No workarounds or \"hacks\" were made to replicate these effects, with the only modifications to them being made for enhancement purposes such as widescreen support.\n\n#### Easy-to-Use Menus\nGameplay settings, graphics settings, input mappings, and audio settings can all be configured with the in-game config menu. The menus can all be used with mouse, controller, or keyboard for maximum convenience.\n\n#### High Framerate Support\nPlay at any framerate you want thanks to functionality provided by RT64! Game objects and terrain, texture scrolling, screen effects, and most HUD elements are all rendered at high framerates. By default, this project is configured to run at your monitor's refresh rate. You can also play at the original framerate of the game if you prefer. **Changing framerate has no effect on gameplay.**\n\n**Note**: External framerate limiters (such as the NVIDIA Control Panel) are known to potentially cause problems, so if you notice any stuttering then turn them off and use the manual framerate slider in the in-game graphics menu instead.\n\n#### Widescreen and Ultrawide Support\nAny aspect ratio is supported, with most effects modded to work correctly in widescreen. The HUD can also be positioned at 16:9 when using ultrawide aspect ratios if preferred.\n\n**Note**: Some animation quirks can be seen at the edges of the screen in certain cutscenes when using very wide aspect ratios.\n\n#### Additional Control Options\nCustomize your experience by setting your stick deadzone to your liking, as well as adjusting the X and Y axis inversion for aiming.\n\n#### Low Input Lag\nThis project has been optimized to have as little input lag as possible, making the game feel more responsive than ever!\n\n#### Linux and Steam Deck Support\nA Linux binary as well as a Flatpak is available for playing on most up-to-date distros, including on the Steam Deck.\n\nTo play on Steam Deck, extract the Linux build onto your deck. Then, in desktop mode, right click the DNZHRecompiled executable file and select \"Add to Steam\". From there, you can return to Gaming mode and configure the controls as needed.\n\n## Planned Features\n* Model Replacements\n* Ray Tracing (via RT64)\n* Multi-language support with support for loading custom translations\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What is static",

      "readme": "# VEH-Based Function Call Obfuscation\n\nObfuscating function calls using Vectored Exception Handlers by redirecting execution through exception-based control flow. Uses byte switching without memory or assembly allocation.\n\n## Explanation\n\nThe implementation intercepts function calls by intentionally triggering CPU exceptions instead of using traditional jumps. When a protected function is called, Windows triggers a `STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION` exception. The Vectored Exception Handler catches this exception before normal execution continues, checks if the instruction pointer (RIP/EIP) matches a registered hook entry, and redirects execution to a hook function by modifying the CPU context.\n\nFor persistent hooking, a trap flag is set after redirection. This triggers a `STATUS_SINGLE_STEP` exception after one instruction executes, allowing the handler to automatically restore the PAGE_GUARD protection (since Windows clears it after each violation). This ensures the hook works on every subsequent call without manual intervention.\n\nAn alternative method uses `INT3` breakpoint instructions (byte switching - writing 0xCC) to trigger `STATUS_BREAKPOINT` exceptions for control flow obfuscation, hiding function calls and jumps behind exception handling logic.\n\n**Key Point**: All operations use byte switching - modifying existing code bytes in-place using `vxmovememory()`. No memory allocation, no assembly generation required.\n\n## Two Obfuscation Methods\n\n### Guard Page Violation Method\nProtects target function addresses with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ | PAGE_GUARD` memory protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`. Each function call triggers a guard page violation exception, which the VEH handler intercepts to redirect execution. The handler modifies RIP/EIP bytes in the CPU context structure.\n\n### INT3 Breakpoint Method  \nPlaces `INT3` (0xCC) instruction at target addresses by switching the first byte to 0xCC. Execution hits the breakpoint, triggers `STATUS_BREAKPOINT`, and the handler redirects control flow to obfuscated paths. Uses `NtFlushInstructionCache` to flush CPU cache after byte modification.\n\n## Using the VEH Obfuscation\n\n- Example in ebytesyscalls.cpp\n\n## Key Functions\n\n- `vehhook::initialize()` - Registers the VEH exception handler with Windows\n- `vehhook::addhook(entry)` - Adds hook entry and sets PAGE_GUARD protection via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n- `vehhook::removehook(entry)` - Removes hook and restores memory protection\n- `vehhook::findhook(address)` - Finds hook entry by original function address\n- `vehhook::triggerint3hook(target, redirect, entry)` - Installs INT3 breakpoint (switches byte to 0xCC) for control flow obfuscation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe exception handler processes three exception types in order:\n\n1. **STATUS_BREAKPOINT** - INT3 breakpoint hits, redirects execution by modifying RIP/EIP\n2. **STATUS_GUARD_PAGE_VIOLATION** - Guard page accessed, redirects and sets trap flag (EFlags |= 0x100)\n3. **STATUS_SINGLE_STEP** - Trap flag triggered, restores PAGE_GUARD for all hooks via `NtProtectVirtualMemory`\n\n**Important Notes**:\n- Memory protection changes use `NtProtectVirtualMemory` via `internals::getprocaddr()` - this is **NOT a direct syscall**, it's the Nt* API resolved dynamically\n- Function addresses are resolved through manual PE parsing via `internals::getprocaddr()` instead of `GetProcAddress()`\n- All byte modifications use `vxmovememory()` - no standard library memory functions\n- INT3 installation uses byte switching (writes 0xCC) then flushes instruction cache via `NtFlushInstructionCache`\n\n## Byte Switching Approach\n\nUnlike traditional hooking that allocates memory or generates assembly:\n- Guard page method: Only modifies memory protection flags (no code bytes changed)\n- INT3 method: Switches one byte (0xCC) in-place, no allocation needed\n- Both methods: Redirect execution via CPU context modification (RIP/EIP), not code patching\n- Exception handlers: Modify existing CPU register state, no new memory required\n\n## Notes\n\nThe VEH obfuscation technique works by leveraging Windows exception handling infrastructure. Control flow redirection happens in the exception handler, making static analysis more difficult since execution jumps aren't visible in the original code.\n\nYou can combine both methods - use guard page hooks for function interception and INT3 breakpoints for general control flow obfuscation throughout your code.\n\nAll operations use byte switching - modifying existing code or CPU state without allocating new memory or generating assembly instructions.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis implementation demonstrates exception-based control flow obfuscation. The technique hides execution flow in exception handlers but can be detected through VEH enumeration, exception frequency analysis, or advanced EDR monitoring. Use as one layer of a multi-layered obfuscation strategy.\n\n# License\n- MIT\n\n\n# Credits \n- AdvDebug for hook -> copymem. (github.com/AdvDebug)\n",

      "readme": "# REP MOV based EPT detection\n\nThis is a basic POC of detecting EPT based hooking or access watch that verifies behaviour of the string instructions when they fault vs when they can fully execute un-interrupted. [@NickEverdox](https://x.com/nickeverdox/status/1981959428846084269) Decided to release a similar version of the concept, so I might as well release my version that I had come up with independently. The main difference is that I don't rely on on a hardware breakpoint, but rather make the instruction overwrite itself. Emulating this behaviour is also very annoying, because the amount of data copied varies greatly even on the same processor depending on the alignment of source/destination operands and the instruction itself. On machines with E-cores the behaviour can be different even with the same parameters.\n\n\n```cpp\nvoid check_ept(const void* address)\n{\n  constexpr uint8_t shellcode[] = {\n    0xFC,                                     // 0:  cld\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xCE,                         // 1:  mov    rsi,rcx\n    0x48, 0x89, 0xD7,                         // 4:  mov    rdi,rdx\n    0x44, 0x89, 0xC1,                         // 7:  mov    ecx, r8d\n    0xF3, 0x48, 0xA5,                         // a:  rep movs QWORD PTR es:[rdi], QWORD PTR ds:[rsi]\n    0xC3                                      // d:  ret\n  };\n  constexpr uint32_t offset_repmov = 0xA;\n\n  const auto code = (char*)VirtualAlloc(nullptr, 0x2000, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);\n  const auto repmov_addr = code + 0x1020;\n  const auto shellcode_addr = repmov_addr - offset_repmov;\n\n  code[0] = 0;\n  memcpy(shellcode_addr, shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));\n\n  Sleep(100);\n\n  __try\n  {\n    ((void(*)(const void* src, void* dst, uint32_t cnt))shellcode_addr)(address, code + 0xF00, 0x200 / 8);\n  }\n  __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)\n  {\n  }\n\n  // REP MOVS will overshoot the copy on every platform except when we're faulting every iteration of the instruction due to EPT.\n  bool is_ok = repmov_addr[8] != 0;\n\n  uint32_t overwrite_count = std::count_if(repmov_addr, repmov_addr + 0x100, [](unsigned char c) { return c != 0; });\n  printf(\"OVERWRITES: %u %s\\n\", overwrite_count, is_ok ? \"NOT DETECTED\" : \"DETECTED\");\n\n  VirtualFree(code, 0, MEM_RELEASE);\n}\n```\n",

      "readme": "# Ryu\nRyu, a fork of Kuzu, is an embedded graph database built for query speed and scalability. Ryu is optimized for handling complex analytical workloads \non very large databases and provides a set of retrieval features, such as a full text search and vector indices. Our core feature set includes:\n\n- Flexible Property Graph Data Model and Cypher query language\n- Embeddable, serverless integration into applications\n- Native full text search and vector index\n- Columnar disk-based storage\n- Columnar sparse row-based (CSR) adjacency list/join indices\n- Vectorized and factorized query processor\n- Novel and very fast join algorithms\n- Multi-core query parallelism\n- Serializable ACID transactions\n- Wasm (WebAssembly) bindings for fast, secure execution in the browser\n\nRyu or RyuGraph is a fork of [Kuzu](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu), which was originally developed by Kuzu Inc. Following Kuzu's archival in October 2025, Ryu continues the development and evolution of this embedded graph database technology. Ryu is maintained by Predictable Labs, Inc. and is available under a permissible license, ensuring the continued advancement of this innovative graph database solution.\n\n## Docs and Blog\n\nTo learn more about Ryu, see our [Documentation](https://ryugraph.io/docs) and [Blog](https://ryugraph.io/blog) page.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nRefer to our [Getting Started](https://ryugraph.io/docs/get-started/) page for your first example.\n\n## Extensions\nRyu has an extension framework that users can dynamically load the functionality you need at runtime.\nWe've developed a list of [official extensions](https://ryugraph.io/docs/extensions/#available-extensions) that you can use to extend Ryu's functionality.\n\nRyu requires you to install the extension before loading and using it.\nNote that Ryu no longer provides the official extension server, where you can directly install any official extensions.\n\nIf you've upgraded to the latest version v0.11.3, Ryu has pre-installed four commonly used extensions (`algo`, `fts`, `json`, `vector`) for you.\nYou do not need to manually INSTALL these extensions.\n\nFor Ryu versions before v0.11.3, or to install extensions that haven't been pre-installed, you have to set up a local extension server.\nThe instructions of setting up a local extension server can be found below.\n\n### Host your own extension server\n\nThe extension server is based on NGINX and is hosted on [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io/predictable-labs/extension-repo). You can pull the Docker image and run it in your environment:\n\n```bash\ndocker pull ghcr.io/predictable-labs/extension-repo:latest\ndocker run -d -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/predictable-labs/extension-repo:latest\n```\n\nIn this example, the extension server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`. You can then install extensions from your server by appending the `FROM` clause to the `INSTALL` command:\n\n```cypher\nINSTALL <EXTENSION_NAME> FROM 'http://localhost:8080/';\n```\n\n## Build from Source\n\nYou can build from source using the instructions provided in the [developer guide](https://ryugraph.io/docs/developer-guide).\n\n## License\nRyu is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n",

Ambiguities organized into three separate buckets: **Syntactic**, **Lexical**, and **Semantic**. It also contains a custom language interpreter to show the complexity of parsing the syntax of a program.\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### 1. The Most Vexing Parse (`vex.cpp`)\n\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 vex.cpp -o vex\n./vex\n```\n\n### 2. The Dangling Else (`dangle_login.cpp`)\n\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 dangle_login.cpp -o dangle_login\n./dangle_login\n```\n\n### 3. Bonus Example (`hmm.cpp`)\n\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 hmm.cpp -o hmm\n./hmm\n```\n\n### 4. Nested Generics (`nest.cpp`)\n\n```bash\n# This fails in C++98\ng++ -std=c++98 nest.cpp -o nest\n\n# This works in C++11 and later\ng++ -std=c++20 nest.cpp -o nest\n./nest\n```\n\n### 5. Dependent Type Names (`temple.cpp`)\n\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 temple.cpp -o temple\n./temple\n```\n\n### 6. Dependent Template Functions (`less.cpp`)\n\n```bash\ng++ -std=c++20 less.cpp -o less\n./less\n```\n\n## Custom Parser\n\nThe `CustomParser/` directory contains **Rember Script**, a toy language interpreter built with Flex and Bison, demonstrating how to create custom parsers.\n\n**Build and Run**:\n```bash\ncd CustomParser\nmake\n./remberscript test.rember\n```\n",
