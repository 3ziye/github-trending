# Omasnap

A native Wayland screenshot and annotation overlay designed for Omarchy and Hyprland.
It captures the focused monitor before mapping an exclusive layer-shell surface, so the
editor never appears in its own screenshot. The editor retains annotations as movable,
resizable vector layers and preserves the monitor's native pixels on scaled displays.

## Features

- Freeform region, window, and full-monitor capture modes.
- Clean window-surface capture through Wayland image-copy protocols. A failed native
  capture stays in the window picker; Omasnap never substitutes a crop of the desktop.
- Select/move/resize layers, mouse-wheel scaling, and eight external recropping handles.
- Arrows, straight lines, smoothed freehand strokes, translucent highlighter strokes,
  rectangles, numbered markers, editable Neucha text, and secure redaction with
  opaque or randomized non-spatial mosaic output.
- Per-layer preset or custom colors (including highlighter ink), undo/redo history,
  OCR-region capture,
  mesh-gradient backdrops, and rendered drop shadows.
- Pin a finished capture as a bottom-right always-on-top layer surface, launched
  from the same `omasnap` executable and visible on every workspace.
- Crash-resistant working snapshots under `/run/user/<UID>/omasnap/` (falling back to
  a private `/tmp/omasnap-<UID>/`), written immediately after selection and overwritten
  after every completed edit. Saving moves that file into `~/Pictures/Screenshots`;
  clipboard output streams the same PNG.
- Verified PNG clipboard output through `wl-copy`/`wl-paste`, plus timestamped files
  under `~/Pictures/Screenshots` by default.
- Correct native-pixel export on fractional or integer-scaled monitors.

## Platform scope

The supported target is **Wayland + Hyprland**, with Omarchy as the primary integration.
The renderer, layer surface, clipboard, and clean-window capture use Wayland protocols;
monitor/window discovery currently calls `hyprctl`. `grim` captures the monitor before
the layer maps. Selection displays that captured frame, while the annotation editor uses
a translucent layer scrim over the live desktop and draws only the selected capture.
Another Wayland compositor could support the application after supplying equivalent
monitor and window discovery; generic Wayland support is not claimed by 1.0.

Runtime commands used by the application:

- `hyprctl`
- `grim`
- `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`
- `tesseract`
- `omarchy-notification-send` when available; saved captures include a thumbnail and
  reopen in Omasnap when clicked. Notification failure does not invalidate output.

## Install on Omarchy

Clone the repository and run the Omarchy installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tobi/omasnap.git
cd omasnap
./install-omarchy
```

The installer uses Omarchy's package helper for missing dependencies, builds in
`~/.cache/omasnap`, and installs under `~/.local`. It does not modify
Hyprland configuration.

### Hyprland binding

Paste this into a Lua config loaded after `require("default.hypr.omarchy")`:

```lua
hl.unbind("PRINT")
hl.unbind("F12")
hl.unbind("ALT + SHIFT + 4")

o.bind("PRINT", "Screenshot", "omasnap")
o.bind("F12", "Screenshot", "omasnap")
o.bind("ALT + SHIFT + 4", "Screenshot", "omasnap")

hl.layer_rule({
  match = { namespace = "^omasnap$" },
  no_anim = true,
  animation = "none",
})
```

Apply and verify:

```bash
hyprctl reload
hyprctl configerrors
hyprctl binds -j | jq -c \
  '[.[] | select(.description == "Screenshot") | {modmask,key,description}]'
```

`omarchy plugin add` is intentionally not used. Omarchy plugins are Quickshell QML
extensions; they do not install native executables or system packages.

Set `OMASNAP_PREFIX` before running `install-omarchy` to use a prefix other than
`~/.local`.

### Manual Arch Linux build

Install the complete build/runtime dependency set:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
  base-devel cmake ninja pkgconf qt6-base layer-shell-qt \
  wayland wayland-protocols hyprland grim wl-clipboard \
  tesseract tesseract-data-eng tesseract-data-tha
```

Build and install:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build build --parallel
cmake --install build
```

The install step places:

- `~/.local/bin/omasnap`
- `~/.local/share/applications/omasnap.desktop`
- `~/.local/share/licenses/omasnap/Neucha-OFL.txt`

Ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`, then verify the installed CLI:

```bash
omasnap --version
omasnap --help
```

## CLI capture modes

Running without arguments opens freeform region selection:

```bash
omasnap
```

Explicit starting modes:

```bash
omasnap --capture-region
omasnap --capture-window
omasnap --capture-fullscreen
```

Compatibility positional names are also accepted:

```bash
omasnap region
omasnap windows
omasnap fullscreen
omasnap smart       # maps to region selection
```
