### Recommended WeChat Chat Export Tools

These are independent open-source projects — this project does not include their code, but our parsers are compatible with their export formats. WeChat auto-decryption is currently unstable, so we recommend using these open-source tools to export chat history, then paste or import into this project:

| Tool | Platform | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [WeChatMsg](https://github.com/LC044/WeChatMsg) | Windows | WeChat chat history export, supports multiple formats |
| [PyWxDump](https://github.com/xaoyaoo/PyWxDump) | Windows | WeChat database decryption & export |
| [留痕 (Liuhen)](https://github.com/greyovo/留痕) | macOS | WeChat chat history export (recommended for Mac users) |

> Tool recommendations from [@therealXiaomanChu](https://github.com/therealXiaomanChu). Thanks to all the open-source authors — together for cyber-immortality!
