      "readme": "## Random guitar pedal board design\n\n### Background\n\nThis is a personal toy project that has gone through several phases, but\nthe common theme has been that it makes absolutely no sense outside of\nthe very specific niche of \"Linus is trying to learn random things about\nelectronics\".\n\nSo keep that in mind: there is very little point to any of this to\nanybody else.  Don't expect some great useful guitar pedal experience.\n\nI call it my \"LEGO for adults\" hobby, because this got started when I\nwanted to extend my traditional after-Christmas activity (which was\nreceiving and building _actual_ LEGO kits, which has been a thing for me\nsince I was a wee tyke) with something else.\n\nSo for Christmas 2024, I got a new soldering iron and randomly started\ndoing guitar pedal kits.  And so over the next month or two, I built at\nleast two dozen kits, and had to literally look for victims to give them\naway to because I had no use for them myself.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Of all the kits I built, the ones I enjoyed the most were the Aion FX\n> ones, and if you are looking for a kit build of traditional analog\n> guitar pedals, I can heartily recommend them.\n>\n> The documentation, the customer service, the components, and the\n> enclosures were all top notch. See [\"Aion FX\"](https://aionfx.com/)\n\nAnyway, after building a lot of these traditional analog guitar pedal\nkits I decided I really wanted to actually understand what they did,\nbecause I really had very little experience with any analog circuits.\n\nWhile I've done some very limited electronics most of my life, almost\nall of it has been related to computers, so it's been either digital\nlogic or power supplies for them.\n\nAlso, I was looking for a different kind of soldering experience where\nthere was less snipping of legs of through-hole components.  I actually\nlike soldering SMT components, but that doesn't tend to be what those\nguitar pedal kits do.\n\nI had done some very limited PCB design with kicad a few years ago, so I\ndecided to just start learning more about analog circuits.  And then it\nkind of grew from that.\n\n### Electrical design\n\nThis is the \"fourth generation\" of my guitar pedal design journey, and\nis a new repository because the goal of the learning experience has\nevolved.\n\nWhat started out being about the analog circuits (and the power rails:\nthose were always a big thing) got to the point where I realized I\nreally want to do a mixed signal design: understanding what the circuits\ndo is one thing, re-creating some analog design from the 70s when you\ndon't actually care about the sound is another thing entirely.\n\nAlso, on the actual analog signal side, I started out using op-amps, but\nas I was attempting to learn how things actually worked, I had switched\nover to a \"discrete components only\" model, and this continues that\ntrend (except for the whole digital side, of course).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To me \"discrete components\" does include more optimized packages:\n> things like dual diodes or matched transistors, but not more complex\n> circuits like a op-amp (or a 555 timer or D Flip-flop or other classic\n> logic IC)\n\nAlso, because I don't typically *listen* to the end result, but look at\nit with a signal generator and an oscilloscope, I've grown to detest\npower supply noise.\n\nNot knowing what I was doing, quite a lot of my circuits have been very\nnoisy indeed, and have coupled in noise from the power supply into the\nsignal chain, and you can really see that on an oscilloscope even when\nit's not always audible.\n\nEven in op-amp designs, where the op-amp itself has a very high PSRR and\nisn't mixing power supply noise into the signal, my biasing circuits\nwere often not great, and so the op-amp would see not just the signal\nbut the power supply noise coming in through the DC biasing.\n\nAnd every time I tried a dual power rail (so that I could just keep the\nsignal ground-referenced), the noise from the switching ended up just\nalways noticeable, and the extra complexity was annoying when a lot of\neffects then didn't have any real use for the dual rail.\n\nFiltering obviously helps, but this is just a long-winded explanation\nfor why I ended up really appreciating the \"bias to ground\" JFET model\nfor the signal input side, and the common drain follower in particular.\n\nThat works with a single JFET (the MMBF5103 worked well for me), but my\nfavorite design so far is a dual-JFET LS844 with the second matched JFET\nused as a current sink.  It has basically infinite input impedance (and\ncould be DC coupled, although I do the coupling capacitor with resistor\nto ground) and gives a good output signal somewhere roughly in the\nmiddle of the single-supply 9V rail.\n\nSee [LS844 Application note](https://www.linearsystems.com/_files/ugd/7e8069_52b1022fbded45fab609459acb337629.pdf)\n\nWhy do I mention this in particular? Mainly because it's a great example\nof how completely *insane* my designs are.  That LS844 is used as a\nvoltage follower with a noticeable DC offset, and that single dual-JFET\nSOT-23-6 component is m",

      "readme": "# ComfyDeploy\n\nRe: Open-sourcing ComfyDeploy\n\nTL;DR: We are open-sourcing ComfyDeploy again, with full platform backend + frontend.\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/qtHUaVNRVM) | [Website](https://www.comfydeploy.com)\n\n---\n\n### How we got here?\n\nIn late 2023, I started ComfyDeploy as an open source project while I was working at my previous company. We had a problem deploying ComfyUI to our production server due to how complicated it is to get ComfyUI into a serverless environment.\n\nLittle did I know I was going to meet my co-founder Nick and embark on a journey I never dreamt of.\n\nI posted on Twitter about this little project that I was working on as an indie hacker, and it blew up overnight. I woke up to 100k impressions on the post. I put up my cal link and people started scheduling calls. I got to talk to a bunch of people across the globe, with people reaching out to help or potentially use ComfyDeploy.\n\nNick was one of the early contributors, and later we decided to apply to a bunch of accelerators together. It was early February, just a couple of weeks after we met. We applied to YC—we were unsure if we would even get in, but we still decided to quit our jobs, and the day after we quit, we got in.\n\nIt was insane to even think that we would have had a chance.\n\n### Life Changing Decision\n\nWe immediately said yes.\n\nWe got into YC with ComfyDeploy around 2.5K MRR.\n\nAround the same timeframe, ComfyOrg was introduced, Stability collapsed, and Flux just came out.\n\nWe kept building ComfyDeploy, for months, and kept things going.\n\nThe company was growing, but very slowly. We realized the biggest issue is that we are still really early, and it takes time for businesses and enterprises to really adopt such a niche tool. And we are not ComfyOrg.\n\n### Dynamic Changes\n\nMeanwhile, closed source models dropped, and a bunch of workflows that we knew became no longer useful.\n\nComing from a game developer background, I saw huge potential with ComfyUI at first, but I never would have imagined that one giant model could do exactly what you put into words, and you still need workflows to fine-tune and control the exact outputs. And ComfyDeploy did make it possible for teams to experiment with this.\n\nWe were just unsure about the future of the company. While we kept getting more and more business inquiries about ComfyUI, this is what really kept us going before giving up. It's a mixed signal.\n\nMeanwhile, my friends bootstrapped their mobile app to $500k a month. I was really stressed—were we going to live up to the aspirations that we set out, both personally and for the company?\n\n### Problems\n\nI feel immensely grateful for the customers that we were able to help, and this is something I feel forever privileged to experience—working with the best creative teams across the globe and brands that I look up to.\n\nBut we were stuck in the middle. First, we are not ComfyOrg; second, closed source models were doing things way better and slowly eating up the market.\n\nAnd it's inevitable that ComfyOrg will have some sort of cloud solution. And we do appreciate all the work ComfyOrg has put into making ComfyUI great again. We realized we would be competing in some ways especially in the cloud space, and we could never grow out of this, which constrained the company's growth at the same time.\n\nAs of today, ComfyDeploy is doing $29k MRR, and our last 30 days' revenue was $50k processed. Which is the highest we have ever got, but also the most depressing day I have ever had.\n\n### So what now?\n\nWe have been working for months on our pay-as-you-go tier—no longer requiring you to talk to us, just pay for the cloud resources you use. And also, going back to our roots: open-sourcing the ENTIRE CLOUD PLATFORM while continuing to support existing customers.\n\nOur current customers and creative teams are the people who kept us going for the last year, and I will be forever grateful. But this might just not be the field for us, and we respect Comfy and do not want to get in the way. And I think it's going to be really good for everyone.\n\n#### What does this mean for current customers: \n\nThe service will stay online and supported until the last standing user!\n\n#### What does this mean for future customers: \nYou can either go with the pay-as-you-go tier to get started, or self-host the entire platform. If ComfyOrg eventually builds something like ComfyDeploy, the official solution will be recommended by us!\n\n#### What does this mean for ComfyDeploy team: \n\nWe will continue supporting existing customers. At the same time we will start exploring new ideas. And this does not mean the end to us. But rather a fresh start. Stay tuned for what's coming next.\n\n#### What I will be doing for the next couple days\n1. Documentation and tutorials to set up ComfyDeploy\n2. Explore new problems that could resonate with us.\n\n### Credits\n\nA list of credits that got us here (doesn't go in order)\nComfy, Nick, Karrix, Jeff, Edgar, Ecjojo, Brad, Aashay and Semil, Jon, Choco",

      "readme": "# [SIGGRAPH Asia 2025] WorldExplorer: Towards Generating Fully-Explorable 3D Scenes\n\nWorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling realistic and unrestricted exploration.\n\nThis is the official repository for the SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 paper \"WorldExplorer: Towards Generating Fully Navigable 3D Scenes\".\n\n[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01799)] [[Project Page](https://mschneider456.github.io/world-explorer/)] [[Video](https://youtu.be/N6NJsNyiv6I)]\n\n![Teaser](docs/teaser.jpg \"WorldExplorer\")\n\nIf you find WorldExplorer useful for your work please consider giving a star ⭐️ and citing:\n\n```\n@InProceedings{schneider_hoellein_2025_worldexplorer,\n    title={WorldExplorer: Towards Generating Fully Navigable 3D Scenes},\n    author={Schneider, Manuel-Andreas and H{\\\"o}llein, Lukas and Nie{\\ss}ner, Matthias},\n    journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2506.01799},\n    year={2025}\n}\n```\n\n\n## Installation\n\nWe have tested the below instructions with PyTorch 2.8.0+cu128, CUDA 12.8, PyTorch3D 0.7.8. \n\n```\nconda env create -f environment.yml\nconda activate worldexplorer\n\ncd model/stable-virtual-camera\npip install -e .\ncd ../..\n\nCUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-12.8 pip install \"git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable\"\npip install diffusers[\"torch\"] transformers protobuf transformers[sentencepiece] easydict plyfile\npip install --upgrade pip setuptools && pip install git+https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio.git@50e0e3c\npip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128\n```\n\nIf you encounter [this issue](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat/issues/249) during 3DGS optimization, it's likely that your CUDA version is not consistent between terminal sessions (check through `nvcc --version`). You can ensure the CUDA version stays fixed by setting the PATH variable in your `~/.bashrc`. For CUDA 12.8, this can be done by running:\n\n```\necho 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.8/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n### Download checkpoints\n\nDownload the pretrained model checkpoints:\n\n```\nwget -O model/Depth_Anything_V2/checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_metric_hypersim_vitl.pth \"https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Metric-Hypersim-Large/resolve/main/depth_anything_v2_metric_hypersim_vitl.pth?download=true\"\n\nwget -O model/Video-Depth-Anything/checkpoints/video_depth_anything_vits.pth \"https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Video-Depth-Anything-Small/resolve/main/video_depth_anything_vits.pth?download=true\"\n``` \n\n### Authenticate with Hugging Face\n\nThe `FLUX.1-dev` model used for initial image generation is gated and requires authentication.\n\n1. Request access to the model on its Hugging Face page:\n   https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev\n\n2. Log in through the terminal and add a read-only token: \n   ```bash\n   pip install -U \"huggingface_hub[cli]\"\n   hf auth login\n   ```\n\nThe weights for the model will automatically be downloaded and saved the first time you generate a scene.\n\n## Usage\n\nWorldExplorer provides a command-line interface through `worldexplorer.py` for generating scene scaffolds (panoramas with known camera extrinsics and intrinsics) and 3D scenes.\n\n### Quick Start\n\nGenerate a complete 3D scene from a text description:\n```bash\npython worldexplorer.py generate \"bioluminescent, gravity-defying, telepathic cosmic jellyfish hive\"\n```\n\nPlease note that full 3D scene generation takes about 6 to 7 hours as 32 videos are generated in the process. The simplest way to track your progress is by checking the output at `./scenes/[theme_name]_[translation_scaling_factor]_[timestamp]/img2trajvid`.\n\n### Available Commands\n\n#### 1. `generate` - Full Pipeline (Scaffold + 3D Expansion)\nGenerates panoramic images from text and expands them into navigable 3D scenes.\n\n```bash\n# Indoor scene with automatic selection (CLIP-based)\npython worldexplorer.py generate \"Modern Apartment\" --mode automatic\n\n# Indoor scene with manual selection (yiels best results!)\npython worldexplorer.py generate \"Cozy Library\" --mode manual\n\n# Indoor scene with fast mode\npython worldexplorer.py generate \"Rustic Farmhouse (Wood, Leather, Wool)\" --mode fast\n\n# Custom/outdoor scene (requires four separate prompts for each viewing direction)\npython worldexplorer.py generate --custom\n\n# Skip 3D expansion (scaffold only)\npython worldexplorer.py generate \"Beach House\" --skip-expansion\n```\n\n**Options:**\n- `--mode, -m`: Panorama scaffold generation mode - `fast` (single output), `automatic` (CLIP selection), or `manual` (human curation)\n- `--translation-scaling, -t`: Movement scale factor (default: 3.0). The higher the translation scaling factor, the further your trajectories will expand into the scene. For indoor scenes the recommended range is 2.0 to 7.0, and for outdoors scenes 8.0 to 20.0. \n- `--skip-expansion`: Generate scaffold only without 3D expansion\n- `--custom, -c`: Custom mode for outdoor scenes or custom indoor scenes\n- `--root-dir`: Directory containing",

      "readme": "# Daedalus Keyboard\n\nDaedalus is an a compact open-source, split, wireless ergonomic keyboard with trackpad and encoder.\n\n![Image](/assets/main-img.jpg)\n\n## Daedalus Keyboard\n\nIt's a 36 key low-profile, split, wireless, ergonomic keyboard that includes a trackpad and a rotary encoder powered with ZMK on 2 Nice!Nano microcontrollers running on 2 110mAh batteries. It features a key splay inspired from the TOTEM, and a key layout modelled after my hand and inspired by the Corne. It's meant to be portable, silent and unobstrusive thanks to the Ambient Twighlight silent switches and the wireless connectivity.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe Daedalus Keyboard has been a hobby project that I worked on during the last year. It has been my first real hardware project that I've done, and I learned a lot throughout the way. Therefore, I aim for this project to be the most open and educational keyboard project possible for everyone.\n\nTherefore, here you will find everything needed to get started or to satiate your curiosity: all of the code, the schematics, the CAD files and even my notes during research.\n\nIf you're interested in building your own keyboard, then the [report](/docs/report.pdf) might interest you. It is a compreheensive document that describes the whole process of creation of the keyboard step by step, whilst giving some useful tips throughout and some valuable lessons learned at the end.\n\n## Repository Navigation\n\nThe repository is split in the following directories:\n\n- **Chassis**: Everything related to the chassis and components that are not hardware - CAD files, drawings and files ready for 3D printing or laser cutting right away\n- **Hardware**: Related to the PCB and electronic components - KiCAD schematic and PCB, and even gerber files to submit to a PCB manufacturer\n- **Firmware**: The code necessary to run the keyboard - Keybinds, ZMK config, etc.\n- **Docs**: The documentation to help you get started building this keyboard or any other - Build log, BOM, research, etc.\n\n## Current development\n\nCurrently I'm working on adding to this repository the following, in order:\n\n- Porting the CATIA files into an open source file format\n- A standalone step by step build guide (& BOM)\n- A contributing/editing guide\n- Publishing the Drawings\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou're welcome to contribute to this project in any way shape or form that is constructive.\n\n## Licence\n\nThis project is licenced differently for each domain, with the intention of promoting open source hardware and software:\n\n- Firmware and code: [GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)](./LICENSE-FIRMWARE)\n- Hardware: [CERN Open Hardware License v2 - Strongly Reciprocal](./LICENSE-HARDWARE)\n- Documentation and Media: [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n",

It offers multiple ways to engage with and leverage our AI agents. This is the interface where you'll bring your AI automation ideas to life:\n\n   **Agent Builder:** For those who want to customize, our intuitive, low-code interface allows you to design and configure your own AI agents. \n   \n   **Workflow Management:** Build, modify, and optimize your automation workflows with ease. You build your agent by connecting blocks, where each block     performs a single action.\n   \n   **Deployment Controls:** Manage the lifecycle of your agents, from testing to production.\n   \n   **Ready-to-Use Agents:** Don't want to build? Simply select from our library of pre-configured agents and put them to work immediately.\n   \n   **Agent Interaction:** Whether you've built your own or are using pre-configured agents, easily run and interact with them through our user-friendly      interface.\n\n   **Monitoring and Analytics:** Keep track of your agents' performance and gain insights to continually improve your automation processes.\n\n[Read this guide](https://docs.agpt.co/server/new_blocks/) to learn how to build your own custom blocks.\n\n### 💽 AutoGPT Server\n\nThe AutoGPT Server is the powerhouse of our platform This is where your agents run. Once deployed, agents can be triggered by external sources and can operate continuously. It contains all the essential components that make AutoGPT run smoothly.\n\n   **Source Code:** The core logic that drives our agents and automation processes.\n   \n   **Infrastructure:** Robust systems that ensure reliable and scalable performance.\n   \n   **Marketplace:** A comprehensive marketplace where you can find and deploy a wide range of pre-built agents.\n\n### 🐙 Example Agents\n\nHere are two examples of what you can do with AutoGPT:\n\n1. **Generate Viral Videos from Trending Topics**\n   - This agent reads topics on Reddit.\n   - It identifies trending topics.\n   - It then automatically creates a short-form video based on the content. \n\n2. **Identify Top Quotes from Videos for Social Media**\n   - This agent subscribes to your YouTube channel.\n   - When you post a new video, it transcribes it.\n   - It uses AI to identify the most impactful quotes to generate a summary.\n   - Then, it writes a post to automatically publish to your social media. \n\nThese examples show just a glimpse of what you can achieve with AutoGPT! You can create customized workflows to build agents for any use case.\n\n---\n",
