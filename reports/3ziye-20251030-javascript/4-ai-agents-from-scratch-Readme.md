# AI Agents From Scratch

Learn to build AI agents locally without frameworks. Understand what happens under the hood before using production frameworks.

## Purpose

This repository teaches you to build AI agents from first principles using **local LLMs** and **node-llama-cpp**. By working through these examples, you'll understand:

- How LLMs work at a fundamental level
- What agents really are (LLM + tools + patterns)
- How different agent architectures function
- Why frameworks make certain design choices

**Philosophy**: Learn by building. Understand deeply, then use frameworks wisely.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- Download models and place in `./models/` folder, details in [DOWNLOAD.md](DOWNLOAD.md)

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Examples
```bash
node intro/intro.js
node simple-agent/simple-agent.js
node react-agent/react-agent.js
```
