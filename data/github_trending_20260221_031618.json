Skills extend its capabilities, allowing it to interact with external services, automate workflows, and perform specialized tasks. This collection helps you discover and install the right skills for your needs.\n\nSkills in this list are sourced from [ClawHub](https://www.clawhub.ai/) (OpenClaw's public skills registry) and categorized for easier discovery.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### ClawHub CLI\n\n> **Note:** As you probably know, they keep renaming things. This reflects the current official docs. We'll update this when they rename it again.\n\n```bash\nnpx clawhub@latest install <skill-slug>\n```\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nCopy the skill folder to one of these locations:\n\n| Location | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| Global | `~/.openclaw/skills/` |\n| Workspace | `<project>/skills/` |\n\nPriority: Workspace > Local > Bundled\n\n### Alternative\n\nYou can also paste the skill's GitHub repository link directly into your assistant's chat and ask it to use it. The assistant will handle the setup automatically in the background.\n\n\n## Why This List Exists?\n\nOpenClaw's public registry (ClawHub) hosts **5,705 community-built skills** as of February 7, 2026. This awesome list has **3,002 skills**. Here's what we filtered out:\n\n| Filter | Excluded |\n|--------|----------|\n| Possibly spam — bulk accounts, bot accounts, test/junk | 1,180 |\n| Crypto / Blockchain / Finance / Trade | 672 |\n| Duplicate / Similar name | 492 |\n| Malicious — identified by security audits published by researchers (excluding VirusTotal) | 396 |\n| Non-English — descriptions not in English | 8 |\n| **Total not taken from OpenClaw's official skill registry** | **2,748** |\n\n\n## Security Notice\n\nSkills in this list are **curated, not audited**. They may be updated, modified, or replaced by their original maintainers at any time after being added here.\n\nBefore installing or using any Agent Skill, review potential security risks and validate the source yourself. OpenClaw has a **VirusTotal partnership** that provides security scanning for skills, visit a skill's page on ClawHub and check the VirusTotal report to see if it's flagged as risky.\n\n**Recommended tools:**\n\n- [Snyk Skill Security Scanner](https://github.com/snyk/agent-scan)\n- [Agent Trust Hub](https://ai.gendigital.com/agent-trust-hub)\n\n> Agent skills can include prompt injections, tool poisoning, hidden malware payloads, or unsafe data handling patterns. Always review the source code before installing and use skills at your own discretion.\n\n**Want to add a skill?** This list only includes skills that are **already published** in the `github.com/openclaw/skills` repository. We do not accept links to personal repos, gists, or any other external source. If your skill isn't in the OpenClaw skills repo yet, publish it there first. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\nIf you believe a skill in this list should be flagged or has a security concern, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-clawdbot-skills/issues) so we can review it.\n\n\n<br/>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/VoltAgent/voltagent\">\n<img width=\"1390\" height=\"296\" alt=\"social\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d8822c0-e97b-4183-a71e-a922ab88e1a0\" />\n</a>\n\n<br/>\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n| | | |\n|---|---|---|\n| [Coding Agents & IDEs](#coding-agents--ides) (133) | [Marketing & Sales](#marketing--sales) (143) | [Communication](#communication) (132) |\n| [Git & GitHub](#git--github) (66) | [Productivity & Tasks](#productivity--tasks) (135) | [Speech & Tran",

Spin up teams of agents that collaborate in your chat.\n\n## Why I Built This\n\n[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.\n\nNanoClaw gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw.git\ncd nanoclaw\nclaude\n```\n\nThen run `/setup`. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.\n\n## Philosophy\n\n**Small enough to understand.** One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.\n\n**Secure by isolation.** Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container on macOS, or Docker). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your host.\n\n**Built for one user.** This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.\n\n**Customization = code changes.** No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.\n\n**AI-native.** No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.\n\n**Skills over features.** Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute [claude code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) like `/add-telegram` that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.\n\n**Best harness, best model.** This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.\n\n## What It Supports\n\n- **WhatsApp I/O** - Message Claude from your phone\n- **Isolated group context** - Each group has its own `CLAUDE.md` memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted\n- **Main channel** - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated\n- **Scheduled tasks** - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back\n- **Web access** - Search and fetch content\n- **Container isolation** - Agents sandboxed in Apple Container (macOS) or Docker (macOS/Linux)\n- **Agent Swarms** - Spin up teams of specialized agents that collaborate on complex tasks (first personal AI assistant to support this)\n- **Optional integrations** - Add Gmail (`/add-gmail`) and more via skills\n\n## Usage\n\nTalk to your assistant with the trigger word (default: `@Andy`):\n\n```\n@Andy send an overview of the sales pipeline every weekday morning at 9am (has access to my Obsidian vault folder)\n@Andy review the git history for the past week each Friday and update the README if there's drift\n@Andy every Monday at 8am, compile news on AI developments from Hacker News and TechCrunch and message me a briefing\n```\n\nFrom the main channel (your self-chat), you can manage groups and tasks:\n```\n@Andy list all scheduled tasks across groups\n@Andy pause the Monday briefing task\n@Andy join the Family Chat group\n```\n\n## Customizing\n\nThere are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:\n\n- \"Change the trigger word to @Bob\"\n- \"Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct\"\n- \"Add a custom greeting when I say good morning\"\n- \"Store conversation summaries weekly\"\n\nOr run `/customize` for guided changes.\n\nThe codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.\n\n## Skills System CLI (Experimental)\n\nThe new determinis",

It is not officially supported and may break without notice. Use at your own risk.\n\n[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/moltworker)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Workers Paid plan](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/developer-platform/) ($5 USD/month) — required for Cloudflare Sandbox containers\n- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) — for Claude access, or you can use AI Gateway's [Unified Billing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/)\n\nThe following Cloudflare features used by this project have free tiers:\n- Cloudflare Access (authentication)\n- Browser Rendering (for browser navigation)\n- AI Gateway (optional, for API routing/analytics)\n- R2 Storage (optional, for persistence)\n\n## Container Cost Estimate\n\nThis project uses a `standard-1` Cloudflare Container instance (1/2 vCPU, 4 GiB memory, 8 GB disk). Below are approximate monthly costs assuming the container runs 24/7, based on [Cloudflare Containers pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/pricing/):\n\n| Resource | Provisioned | Monthly Usage | Included Free | Overage | Approx. Cost |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------|--------------|\n| Memory | 4 GiB | 2,920 GiB-hrs | 25 GiB-hrs | 2,895 GiB-hrs | ~$26/mo |\n| CPU (at ~10% utilization) | 1/2 vCPU | ~2,190 vCPU-min | 375 vCPU-min | ~1,815 vCPU-min | ~$2/mo |\n| Disk | 8 GB | 5,840 GB-hrs | 200 GB-hrs | 5,640 GB-hrs | ~$1.50/mo |\n| Workers Paid plan | | | | | $5/mo |\n| **Total** | | | | | **~$34.50/mo** |\n\nNotes:\n- CPU is billed on **active usage only**, not provisioned capacity. The 10% utilization estimate is a rough baseline for a lightly-used personal assistant; your actual cost will vary with usage.\n- Memory and disk are billed on **provisioned capacity** for the full time the container is running.\n- To reduce costs, configure `SANDBOX_SLEEP_AFTER` (e.g., `10m`) so the container sleeps when idle. A container that only runs 4 hours/day would cost roughly ~$5-6/mo in compute on top of the $5 plan fee.\n- Network egress, Workers/Durable Objects requests, and logs are additional but typically minimal for personal use.\n- See the [instance types table](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/pricing/) for other options (e.g., `lite` at 256 MiB/$0.50/mo memory or `standard-4` at 12 GiB for heavier workloads).\n\n## What is OpenClaw?\n\n[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) is a personal AI assistant with a gateway architecture that connects to multiple chat platforms. Key features:\n\n- **Control UI** - Web-based chat interface at the gateway\n- **Multi-channel support** - Telegram, Discord, Slack\n- **Device pairing** - Secure DM authentication requiring explicit approval\n- **Persistent conversations** - Chat history and context across sessions\n- **Agent runtime** - Extensible AI capabilities with workspace and skills\n\nThis project packages OpenClaw to run in a [Cloudflare Sandbox](https://developers.cloudflare.com/sandbox/) container, providing a fully managed, always-on deployment without needing to self-host. Optional R2 storage enables persistence across container restarts.\n\n## Architecture\n\n![moltworker architecture](./assets/architecture.png)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n_Cloudflare Sandboxes are available on the [Workers Paid plan](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/plans)._\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Set your API key (direct Anthropic access)\nnpx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\n# Or use Cloudflare AI Gateway instead (see \"Optional: Cloudflare AI Gateway\" below)\n# npx wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY\n# npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID\n# npx wrangler secret put CF_AI_GATEWAY_GATEWAY_ID\n\n# Generate and set a gateway token (required for remote access)\n# Save this token - you'll need it to access the Control UI\nexport MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)\necho \"Your gateway token: $MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN\"\necho \"$MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN\" | npx wrangler secret put MOLTBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN\n\n# Deploy\nnpm run deploy\n```\n\nAfter deploying, open the Control UI with your token:\n\n```\nhttps://your-worker.workers.dev/?token=YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN\n```\n\nReplace `your-worker` with your actual worker subdomain and `YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN` with the token you generated above.\n\n**Note:** The first request may take 1-2 minutes while the container starts.\n\n> **Important:** You will not be able to use the Control UI until you complete the following steps.

Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).\n\n## Why Plugins\n\nCowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.\n\nEach plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific job function. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your company — your tools, your terminology, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.\n\n## Plugin Marketplace\n\nWe're open-sourcing 11 plugins built and inspired by our own work:\n\n| Plugin | How it helps | Connectors |\n|--------|-------------|------------|\n| **[productivity](./productivity)** | Manage tasks, calendars, daily workflows, and personal context so you spend less time repeating yourself. | Slack, Notion, Asana, Linear, Jira, Monday, ClickUp, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[sales](./sales)** | Research prospects, prep for calls, review your pipeline, draft outreach, and build competitive battlecards. | Slack, HubSpot, Close, Clay, ZoomInfo, Notion, Jira, Fireflies, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[customer-support](./customer-support)** | Triage tickets, draft responses, package escalations, research customer context, and turn resolved issues into knowledge base articles. | Slack, Intercom, HubSpot, Guru, Jira, Notion, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[product-management](./product-management)** | Write specs, plan roadmaps, synthesize user research, keep stakeholders updated, and track the competitive landscape. | Slack, Linear, Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Jira, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Pendo, Intercom, Fireflies |\n| **[marketing](./marketing)** | Draft content, plan campaigns, enforce brand voice, brief on competitors, and report on performance across channels. | Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, Klaviyo |\n| **[legal](./legal)** | Review contracts, triage NDAs, navigate compliance, assess risk, prep for meetings, and draft templated responses. | Slack, Box, Egnyte, Jira, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[finance](./finance)** | Prep journal entries, reconcile accounts, generate financial statements, analyze variances, manage close, and support audits. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Slack, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[data](./data)** | Query, visualize, and interpret datasets — write SQL, run statistical analysis, build dashboards, and validate your work before sharing. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Hex, Amplitude, Jira |\n| **[enterprise-search](./enterprise-search)** | Find anything across email, chat, docs, and wikis — one query across all your company's tools. | Slack, Notion, Guru, Jira, Asana, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[bio-research](./bio-research)** | Connect to preclinical research tools and databases (literature search, genomics analysis, target prioritization) to accelerate early-stage life sciences R&D. | PubMed, BioRender, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, ChEMBL, Synapse, Wiley, Owkin, Open Targets, Benchling |\n| **[cowork-plugin-management](./cowork-plugin-management)** | Create new plugins or customize existing ones for your organization's specific tools and workflows. | — |\n\nInstall these directly from Cowork, browse the full collection here on GitHub, or build your own.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Cowork\n\nInstall plugins from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace first\nclaude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins\n\n# Then install a specific plugin\nclaude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins\n```\n\nOnce installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (e.g., `/sales:call-prep`, `/data:write-query`).\n\n## How Plugins Work\n\nEvery plugin follows the same structure:\n\n```\nplugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest\n├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections\n├── commands/                    # Slash commands you invoke explicitly\n└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically\n```\n\n- **Skills** encode the domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows Claude needs to give you useful help. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant.\n- **Commands** are explicit actions you trigger (e.g., `/finance:reconciliation`, `/product-management:write-spec`).\n- **Connectors** wire Claude to the external tools your role depends on — CRMs, project trackers, data warehouses, design tools, and more — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).\n\nEvery component is file-based — markdown and ",

Built for the AI era.\n\n![beautiful-mermaid sequence diagram example](hero.png)\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beautiful-mermaid.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/beautiful-mermaid)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\n\n[**Live Demo & Samples**](https://agents.craft.do/mermaid)\n\n**[→ Use it live in Craft Agents](https://agents.craft.do)**\n\n</div>\n\n---\n\n## Why We Built This\n\nDiagrams are essential for AI-assisted programming. When you're working with an AI coding assistant, being able to visualize data flows, state machines, and system architecture—directly in your terminal or chat interface—makes complex concepts instantly graspable.\n\n[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is the de facto standard for text-based diagrams. It's brilliant. But the default renderer has problems:\n\n- **Aesthetics** — Might be personal preference, but wished they looked more professional\n- **Complex theming** — Customizing colors requires wrestling with CSS classes\n- **No terminal output** — Can't render to ASCII for CLI tools\n- **Heavy dependencies** — Pulls in a lot of code for simple diagrams\n\nWe built `beautiful-mermaid` at [Craft](https://craft.do) to power diagrams in [Craft Agents](https://agents.craft.do). It's fast, beautiful, and works everywhere—from rich UIs to plain terminals.\n\n\nThe ASCII rendering engine is based on [mermaid-ascii](https://github.com/AlexanderGrooff/mermaid-ascii) by Alexander Grooff. We ported it from Go to TypeScript and extended it Thank you Alexander for the excellent foundation! (And inspiration that this was possible.)\n\n## Features\n\n- **5 diagram types** — Flowcharts, State, Sequence, Class, and ER diagrams\n- **Dual output** — SVG for rich UIs, ASCII/Unicode for terminals\n- **15 built-in themes** — And dead simple to add your own\n- **Full Shiki compatibility** — Use any VS Code theme directly\n- **Live theme switching** — CSS custom properties, no re-render needed\n- **Mono mode** — Beautiful diagrams from just 2 colors\n- **Zero DOM dependencies** — Pure TypeScript, works everywhere\n- **Ultra-fast** — Renders 100+ diagrams in under 500ms\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install beautiful-mermaid\n# or\nbun add beautiful-mermaid\n# or\npnpm add beautiful-mermaid\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### SVG Output\n\n```typescript\nimport { renderMermaid } from 'beautiful-mermaid'\n\nconst svg = await renderMermaid(`\n  graph TD\n    A[Start] --> B{Decision}\n    B -->|Yes| C[Action]\n    B -->|No| D[End]\n`)\n```\n\n### ASCII Output\n\n```typescript\nimport { renderMermaidAscii } from 'beautiful-mermaid'\n\nconst ascii = renderMermaidAscii(`graph LR; A --> B --> C`)\n```\n\n```\n┌───┐     ┌───┐     ┌───┐\n│   │     │   │     │   │\n│ A │────►│ B │────►│ C │\n│   │     │   │     │   │\n└───┘     └───┘     └───┘\n```\n\n### Browser (Script Tag)\n\nFor non-bundled environments, include via CDN:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/beautiful-mermaid/dist/beautiful-mermaid.browser.global.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  const { renderMermaid, THEMES } = beautifulMermaid;\n  renderMermaid('graph TD; A-->B').then(svg => { ... });\n</script>\n```\n\nAlso available via [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/beautiful-mermaid/dist/beautiful-mermaid.browser.global.js). The bundle exposes `renderMermaid`, `renderMermaidAscii`, `THEMES`, `DEFAULTS`, and `fromShikiTheme` on the global `beautifulMermaid` object.\n\n---\n\n## Theming\n\nThe theming system is the heart of `beautiful-mermaid`. It's designed to be both powerful and dead simple.\n\n### The Two-Color Foundation\n\nEvery diagram needs just two colors: **background** (`bg`) and **foreground** (`fg`). That's it. From these two colors, the entire diagram is derived using `color-mix()`:\n\n```typescript\nconst svg = await renderMermaid(diagram, {\n  bg: '#1a1b26',  // Background\n  fg: '#a9b1d6',  // Foreground\n})\n```\n\nThis is **Mono Mode**—a coherent, beautiful diagram from just two colors. The system automatically derives:\n\n| Element | Derivation |\n|---------|------------|\n| Text | `--fg` at 100% |\n| Secondary text | `--fg` at 60% into `--bg` |\n| Edge labels | `--fg` at 40% into `--bg` |\n| Connectors | `--fg` at 30% into `--bg` |\n| Arrow heads | `--fg` at 50% into `--bg` |\n| Node fill | `--fg` at 3% into `--bg` |\n| Node stroke | `--fg` at 20% into `--bg` |\n\n### Enriched Mode\n\nFor richer themes, you can provide optional \"enrichment\" colors that override specific derivations:\n\n```typescript\nconst svg = await renderMermaid(diagram, {\n  bg: '#1a1b26',\n  fg: '#a9b1d6',\n  // Optional enrichment:\n  line: '#3d59a1',    // Edge/connector color\n  accent: '#7aa2f7',  // Arrow heads, highlights\n  muted: '#565f89',   // Secondary text, labels\n  surface: '#292e42', // Node fill tint\n  border: '#3d59a1',  // Node stroke\n})\n```\n\nIf an enrichment color isn't provided, it falls back to the `color-mix()` derivation. This means you can provide just t",

      "readme": "# Karpathy-Inspired Claude Code Guidelines\n\nA single `CLAUDE.md` file to improve Claude Code behavior, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.\n\n## The Problems\n\nFrom Andrej's post:\n\n> \"The models make wrong assumptions on your behalf and just run along with them without checking. They don't manage their confusion, don't seek clarifications, don't surface inconsistencies, don't present tradeoffs, don't push back when they should.\"\n\n> \"They really like to overcomplicate code and APIs, bloat abstractions, don't clean up dead code... implement a bloated construction over 1000 lines when 100 would do.\"\n\n> \"They still sometimes change/remove comments and code they don't sufficiently understand as side effects, even if orthogonal to the task.\"\n\n## The Solution\n\nFour principles in one file that directly address these issues:\n\n| Principle | Addresses |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| **Think Before Coding** | Wrong assumptions, hidden confusion, missing tradeoffs |\n| **Simplicity First** | Overcomplication, bloated abstractions |\n| **Surgical Changes** | Orthogonal edits, touching code you shouldn't |\n| **Goal-Driven Execution** | Leverage through tests-first, verifiable success criteria |\n\n## The Four Principles in Detail\n\n### 1. Think Before Coding\n\n**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**\n\nLLMs often pick an interpretation silently and run with it. This principle forces explicit reasoning:\n\n- **State assumptions explicitly** — If uncertain, ask rather than guess\n- **Present multiple interpretations** — Don't pick silently when ambiguity exists\n- **Push back when warranted** — If a simpler approach exists, say so\n- **Stop when confused** — Name what's unclear and ask for clarification\n\n### 2. Simplicity First\n\n**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**\n\nCombat the tendency toward overengineering:\n\n- No features beyond what was asked\n- No abstractions for single-use code\n- No \"flexibility\" or \"configurability\" that wasn't requested\n- No error handling for impossible scenarios\n- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it\n\n**The test:** Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.\n\n### 3. Surgical Changes\n\n**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**\n\nWhen editing existing code:\n\n- Don't \"improve\" adjacent code, comments, or formatting\n- Don't refactor things that aren't broken\n- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently\n- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it\n\nWhen your changes create orphans:\n\n- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused\n- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked\n\n**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.\n\n### 4. Goal-Driven Execution\n\n**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**\n\nTransform imperative tasks into verifiable goals:\n\n| Instead of... | Transform to... |\n|--------------|-----------------|\n| \"Add validation\" | \"Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass\" |\n| \"Fix the bug\" | \"Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass\" |\n| \"Refactor X\" | \"Ensure tests pass before and after\" |\n\nFor multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:\n\n```\n1. [Step] → verify: [check]\n2. [Step] → verify: [check]\n3. [Step] → verify: [check]\n```\n\nStrong success criteria let the LLM loop independently. Weak criteria (\"make it work\") require constant clarification.\n\n## Install\n\n**Option A: Claude Code Plugin (recommended)**\n\nFrom within Claude Code, first add the marketplace:\n```\n/plugin marketplace add forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills\n```\n\nThen install the plugin:\n```\n/plugin install andrej-karpathy-skills@karpathy-skills\n```\n\nThis installs the guidelines as a Claude Code plugin, making the skill available across all your projects.\n\n**Option B: CLAUDE.md (per-project)**\n\nNew project:\n```bash\ncurl -o CLAUDE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md\n```\n\nExisting project (append):\n```bash\necho \"\" >> CLAUDE.md\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills/main/CLAUDE.md >> CLAUDE.md\n```\n\n## Key Insight\n\nFrom Andrej:\n\n> \"LLMs are exceptionally good at looping until they meet specific goals... Don't tell it what to do, give it success criteria and watch it go.\"\n\nThe \"Goal-Driven Execution\" principle captures this: transform imperative instructions into declarative goals with verification loops.\n\n## How to Know It's Working\n\nThese guidelines are working if you see:\n\n- **Fewer unnecessary changes in diffs** — Only requested changes appear\n- **Fewer rewrites due to overcomplication** — Code is simple the first time\n- **Clarifying questions come before implementation** — Not after mistakes\n- **Clean, minimal PRs** — No drive-by refactoring or \"improvements\"\n\n## Customization\n\nThese guidelines are designed to be merged with project-specific instructions. Add them to your existing `CLAUDE.m",

Rules are toggled automatically based on your project setup.\n2. **Dead code**: Detects unused files, exports, types, and duplicates.\n\nDiagnostics are filtered through your config, then scored by severity (errors weigh more than warnings) to produce a **0–100 health score** (75+ Great, 50–74 Needs work, <50 Critical).\n\n## Install\n\nRun this at your project root:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y react-doctor@latest .\n```\n\nUse `--verbose` to see affected files and line numbers:\n\n```bash\nnpx -y react-doctor@latest . --verbose\n```\n\n## Install for your coding agent\n\nTeach your coding agent all 47+ React best practice rules:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://react.doctor/install-skill.sh | bash\n```\n\nSupports Cursor, Claude Code, Amp Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Windsurf, and Antigravity.\n\n## GitHub Actions\n\n```yaml\n- uses: actions/checkout@v5\n  with:\n    fetch-depth: 0 # required for --diff\n- uses: millionco/react-doctor@main\n  with:\n    diff: main\n    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\n| Input          | Default | Description                                                       |\n| -------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `directory`    | `.`     | Project directory to scan                                         |\n| `verbose`      | `true`  | Show file details per rule                                        |\n| `project`      |         | Workspace project(s) to scan (comma-separated)                    |\n| `diff`         |         | Base branch for diff mode.

Features floating glass-like panels, rounded corners, smooth animations, and a deeply refined UI.\n\n- [easemate](https://x.com/easemate)\n- [easemate Nav](https://x.com/Jakubantalik/status/1952672176450215944)\n- [easemate effects](https://x.com/aaroniker/status/1989727838992539655)\n\n\n![Islands Dark Screenshot](assets/CleanShot%202026-02-14%20at%2021.47.05@2x.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Deep dark canvas (`#131217`) with floating panels\n- Glass-effect borders with directional light simulation (brighter top/left, subtle bottom/right)\n- Rounded corners on all panels, notifications, command palette, and sidebars\n- Pill-shaped activity bar with glass selection indicators\n- Breadcrumb bar and status bar that dim when not hovered\n- Tab close buttons that fade in on hover\n- Smooth transitions on sidebar selections, scrollbars, and status bar\n- Pill-shaped scrollbar thumbs\n- Color-matched icon glow effect (works best with [Seti Folder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=l-igh-t.vscode-theme-seti-folder) icon theme)\n- Warm syntax highlighting with comprehensive language support (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, HTML/CSS, JSON, YAML, Markdown)\n- IBM Plex Mono in the editor, FiraCode Nerd Font Mono in the terminal\n\n![Islands Dark Screenshot UI](assets/CleanShot%202026-02-14%20at%2021.45.00@2x.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nThis theme has two parts: a **color theme** and **CSS customizations** that create the floating glass panel look.\n\n### One-Liner Install (Recommended)\n\nThe fastest way to install:\n\n#### macOS/Linux\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands/main/bootstrap.sh | bash\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\nirm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n### Manual Clone Install\n\nIf you prefer to clone first:\n\n#### macOS/Linux\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands.git islands-dark\ncd islands-dark\n./install.sh\n```\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\ngit clone https://github.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands.git islands-dark\ncd islands-dark\n.\\install.ps1\n```\n\nThe scripts will automatically:\n- ✅ Install the Islands Dark theme extension\n- ✅ Install the Custom UI Style extension\n- ✅ Install Bear Sans UI fonts\n- ✅ Back up your existing settings and apply Islands Dark settings\n- ✅ Enable Custom UI Style and reload VS Code\n\n> **Note:** IBM Plex Mono and FiraCode Nerd Font Mono must be installed separately (the script will remind you).\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nIf you prefer to install manually, follow these steps:\n\n#### Step 1: Install the theme\n\nClone this repo and copy the extension files:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands.git islands-dark\ncd islands-dark\nmkdir -p ~/.vscode/extensions/bwya77.islands-dark-1.0.0\ncp package.json ~/.vscode/extensions/bwya77.islands-dark-1.0.0/\ncp -r themes ~/.vscode/extensions/bwya77.islands-dark-1.0.0/\n```\n\nOn Windows (PowerShell):\n```powershell\ngit clone https://github.com/bwya77/vscode-dark-islands.git islands-dark\ncd islands-dark\n$ext = \"$env:USERPROFILE\\.vscode\\extensions\\bwya77.islands-dark-1.0.0\"\nNew-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $ext -Force\nCopy-Item package.json $ext\\\nCopy-Item themes $ext\\themes -Recurse\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Install the Custom UI Style extension\n\nThe floating panels, rounded corners, glass borders, and animations are powered by the **Custom UI Style** extension.\n\n1. Open **Extensions** in VS Code: (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)\n2. Search for **Custom UI Style** (by `subframe7536`)\n3. Click **Install**\n\n#### Step 3: Install recommended icon theme\n\nFor the best experience with the color-matched icon glow effect, install the **Seti Folder** icon theme:\n\n1. Open **Extensions** in VS Code (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)\n2. Search for **[Seti Folder](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=l-igh-t.vscode-theme-seti-folder)** (by `l-igh-t`)\n3. Click **Install**\n4. Set it as your icon theme: **Command Palette** > **Preferences: File Icon Theme** > **Seti Folder**\n\n#### Step 5: Install fonts\n\nThis theme uses two fonts:\n\n- **IBM Plex Mono** — used in the editor\n- **FiraCode Nerd Font Mono** — used in the terminal\n- **Bear Sans UI** — used in the sidebar, tabs, command center, and status bar (included in `fonts/` folder)\n\nTo install Bear Sans UI:\n1. Open the `fonts/` folder in this repo\n2. Select all `.otf` files and double-click to open in Font Book (macOS) or right-click > Install (Windows)\n\nIf you prefer different fonts, update the `editor.fontFamily`, `terminal.integ",

This provides more reliable context and allows the skills to stay up-to-date with upstream changes over time. If you primarily work with Vue/Vite/Nuxt, this aims to be a comprehensive one-stop collection.\n\nThe project is also designed to be flexible - you can use it as a template to generate your own skills collection.\n\n### Skills vs llms.txt vs AGENTS.md\n\nTo me, the value of skills lies in being **shareable** and **on-demand**.\n\nBeing shareable makes prompts easier to manage and reuse across projects. Being on-demand means skills can be pulled in as needed, scaling far beyond what any agent's context window could fit at once.\n\nYou might hear people say \"AGENTS.md outperforms skills\". I think that's true — AGENTS.md loads everything upfront, so agents always respect it, whereas skills can have false negatives where agents don't pull them in when ",

This way,\nprojects with shared values can share their trust decisions with each other\nand create a larger, more comprehensive web of trust across the ecosystem.\nUsers already proven to be trustworthy in one project can automatically\nbe assumed trustworthy in another project, and so on.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> This is an experimental system in use by [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty).\n> We'll continue to improve the system based on experience and feedback.\n\n## Why?\n\nOpen source has always worked on a system of _trust and verify_.\n\nHistorically, the effort required to understand a codebase, implement\na change, and submit that change for review was high enough that it\nnaturally filtered out many low quality contributions from unqualified people.\nFor over 20 years of my life, this was enough for my projects as well\nas enough for most others.\n\nUnfortunately, the landscape has changed particularly with the advent\nof AI tools that allow people to trivially create plausible-looking but\nextremely low-quality contributions with little to no true understanding.\nContributors can no longer be trusted based on the minimal barrier to entry\nto simply submit a change.\n\nBut, open source still works on trust! And every project has a definite\ngroup of trusted individuals (maintainers) and a larger group of probably\ntrusted individuals (active members of the community in any form). So,\nlet's move to an explicit trust model where trusted individuals can vouch\nfor others, and those vouched individuals can then contribute.\n\n## Who is Vouched?\n\n**Who** and **how** someone is vouched or denounced is left entirely up to the\nproject integrating the system. Additionally, **what** consequences\na vouched or denounced person has is also fully up to the project.\nImplement a policy that works for your project and community.\n\n## Usage\n\n### GitHub\n\nIntegrating vouch into a GitHub project is easy with the\n[provided GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/tree/main/action).\nBy choosing which actions to use, you can fully control how\nusers are vouched and what they can or can't do.\n\nFor an example, look at this repository! It fully integrates vouch.\n\nBelow is a list of the actions and a brief description of their function.\nSee the linked README in the action directory for full usage details.\n\n| Action                                                        | Trigger               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [check-issue](action/check-issue/README.md)                   | `issues`              | Check if an issue author is vouched on open or reopen. Bots and collaborators with write access are automatically allowed. Optionally auto-close issues from unvouched or denounced users. |\n| [check-pr](action/check-pr/README.md)                         | `pull_request_target` | Check if a PR author is vouched on open or reopen. Bots and collaborators with write access are automatically allowed. Optionally auto-close PRs from unvouched or denounced users.        |\n| [check-user](action/check-user/README.md)                     | Any                   | Check if a GitHub user is vouched. Outputs the user's status and fails the step by default if the user is not vouched.

Download the package\n> curl -O https://registry.npmjs.org/@m1heng-clawd/feishu/-/feishu-0.1.3.tgz\n>\n> # 2. Install from local file\n> openclaw plugins install ./feishu-0.1.3.tgz\n> ```\n\n### Upgrade\n\n```bash\nopenclaw plugins update feishu\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n1. Create a self-built app on [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn)\n2. Get your App ID and App Secret from the Credentials page\n3. Enable required permissions (see below)\n4. **Configure event subscriptions** (see below) ⚠️ Important\n5. Configure the plugin:\n\n#### Required Permissions\n\n| Permission | Scope | Description |\n|------------|-------|-------------|\n| `im:message` | Messaging | Send and receive messages |\n| `im:message.p2p_msg:readonly` | DM | Read direct messages to bot |\n| `im:message.group_at_msg:readonly` | Group | Receive @mention messages in groups |\n| `im:message:send_as_bot` | Send | Send messages as the bot |\n| `im:resource` | Media | Upload and download images/files |\n\n#### Optional Permissions\n\n| Permission | Scope | Description |\n|------------|-------|-------------|\n| `contact:user.base:readonly` | User info | Get basic user info (required to resolve sender display names for speaker attribution) |\n| `im:message.group_msg` | Group | Read all group messages (sensitive) |\n| `im:message:readonly` | Read | Get message history |\n| `im:message:update` | Edit | Update/edit sent messages |\n| `im:message:recall` | Recall | Recall sent messages |\n| `im:message.reactions:read` | Reactions | View message reactions |\n\n#### Tool Permissions\n\n**Read-only** (minimum required):\n\n| Permission | Tool | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `docx:document:readonly` | `feishu_doc` | Read documents |\n| `drive:drive:readonly` | `feishu_drive` | List folders, get file info |\n| `wiki:wiki:readonly` | `feishu_wiki` | List spaces, list nodes, get node info, search |\n| `bitable:app:readonly` | `feishu_bitable` | Read bitable records and fields |\n| `task:task:read` | `feishu_task_get` | Get task details |\n\n**Read-write** (optional, for create/edit/delete operations):\n\n| Permission | Tool | Description |\n|------------|------|-------------|\n| `docx:document` | `feishu_doc` | Create/edit documents |\n| `docx:document.block:convert` | `feishu_doc` | Markdown to blocks conversion (required for write/append/create_and_write; also used by `feishu_drive.import_document`) |\n| `drive:drive` | `feishu_doc`, `feishu_drive` | Upload images to documents, create folders, move/delete files |\n| `wiki:wiki` | `feishu_wiki` | Create/move/rename wiki nodes |\n| `bitable:app` | `feishu_bitable` | Create/update/delete bitable records and manage fields |\n| `task:task:write` | `feishu_task_create`, `feishu_task_update`, `feishu_task_delete` | Create/update/delete tasks |\n\n> Task scope names may vary slightly in Feishu console UI. If needed, search for Task-related permissions and grant read/write accordingly.\n\n#### Drive Access ⚠️\n\n> **Important:** Bots don't have their own \"My Space\" (root folder). Bots can only access files/folders that have been **shared with them**.\n\nTo let the bot manage files:\n1. Create a folder in your Feishu Drive\n2. Right-click the folder → **Share** → search for your bot name\n3. Grant appropriate permission (view/edit)\n\nWithout this step, `feishu_drive` operations like `create_folder` will fail because the bot has no root folder to create in.\n\n#### Wiki Space Access ⚠️\n\n> **Important:** API permissions alone are not enough for wiki access. You must also add the bot to each wiki space.\n\n1. Open the wiki space you want the bot to access\n2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) → **Members**\n3. Click **Add Member** → search for your bot name\n4. Select appropriate permission level (view/edit)\n\nWithout this step, `feishu_wiki` will return empty results even with correct API permissions.\n\nReference: [Wiki FAQ - How to add app to wiki](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/wiki-v2/wiki-qa#a40ad4ca)\n\n#### Bitable Access ⚠️\n\n> **Important:** Like other resources, the bot can only access bitables that have been **shared with it**.\n\nTo let the bot access a bitable:\n1. Open the bitable you want the bot to access\n2. Click **Share** button → search for your bot name\n3. Grant appropriate permission (view/edit)\n\nThe `feishu_bitable` tools support both URL formats:\n- `/base/XXX?table=YYY` - Standard bitable URL\n- `/wiki/XXX?table=YYY` - Bitable embedded in wiki (auto-converts to app_token)\n\n#### Event Subscriptions ⚠️\n\n> **This is the ",
