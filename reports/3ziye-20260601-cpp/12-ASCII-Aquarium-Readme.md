        ASCII Aquarium turns the common 320x240 CYD touchscreen into a living little
desktop aquarium with swimming ASCII fish, rising bubbles, swaying seaweed,
tap-to-feed flakes, occasional octopus and seahorse visitors, touch controls,
Wi-Fi time sync, persistent settings, and SD-card screenshot capture.
</p>
<p>
        It is not a video loop. The aquarium is rendered live on the ESP32, with fish
that wander, school, turn around, change brightness, avoid each other, and chase
food when you tap the glass.

The easiest way to install ASCII Aquarium
 is with the browser flasher:

[Flash ASCII Aquarium CYD](https://power-pill.github.io/ASCII-Aquarium/)

You will need:

- A supported [CYD board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004971720824.html) connected by a USB data cable.
- Chrome or Edge on a desktop computer.
- The Arduino IDE Serial Monitor closed, if it was open.

Open the flasher page, click **Flash ASCII Aquarium**, choose the CYD serial
port, and let the installer finish.

## Basic Controls ><((((*>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
 <p>• Tap the top-left corner to reveal the hidden HUD.</p>
 <p>• Tap the tank to drop food.</p>
 <p>• Use the settings panel to tune fish, bubbles, visitors, seaweed, clock, and
  backgrounds.</p>
 <p>• Use the Wi-Fi panel to connect to a network and sync internet time.</p>
 <p>• Use the capture panel to save BMP sequences to the SD Card. BEWARE - this is EXTREMELY slow since the fishtank simulation is slowed down to allow every frame to be captured.</p>
 <p>• Press and hold the BOOT button on the back of the CYD to save BMP screenshots to the SD card.</p>
