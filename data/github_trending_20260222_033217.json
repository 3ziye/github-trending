Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).\n\n## Why Plugins\n\nCowork lets you set the goal and Claude delivers finished, professional work. Plugins let you go further: tell Claude how you like work done, which tools and data to pull from, how to handle critical workflows, and what slash commands to expose — so your team gets better and more consistent outcomes.\n\nEach plugin bundles the skills, connectors, slash commands, and sub-agents for a specific job function. Out of the box, they give Claude a strong starting point for helping anyone in that role. The real power comes when you customize them for your company — your tools, your terminology, your processes — so Claude works like it was built for your team.\n\n## Plugin Marketplace\n\nWe're open-sourcing 11 plugins built and inspired by our own work:\n\n| Plugin | How it helps | Connectors |\n|--------|-------------|------------|\n| **[productivity](./productivity)** | Manage tasks, calendars, daily workflows, and personal context so you spend less time repeating yourself. | Slack, Notion, Asana, Linear, Jira, Monday, ClickUp, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[sales](./sales)** | Research prospects, prep for calls, review your pipeline, draft outreach, and build competitive battlecards. | Slack, HubSpot, Close, Clay, ZoomInfo, Notion, Jira, Fireflies, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[customer-support](./customer-support)** | Triage tickets, draft responses, package escalations, research customer context, and turn resolved issues into knowledge base articles. | Slack, Intercom, HubSpot, Guru, Jira, Notion, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[product-management](./product-management)** | Write specs, plan roadmaps, synthesize user research, keep stakeholders updated, and track the competitive landscape. | Slack, Linear, Asana, Monday, ClickUp, Jira, Notion, Figma, Amplitude, Pendo, Intercom, Fireflies |\n| **[marketing](./marketing)** | Draft content, plan campaigns, enforce brand voice, brief on competitors, and report on performance across channels. | Slack, Canva, Figma, HubSpot, Amplitude, Notion, Ahrefs, SimilarWeb, Klaviyo |\n| **[legal](./legal)** | Review contracts, triage NDAs, navigate compliance, assess risk, prep for meetings, and draft templated responses. | Slack, Box, Egnyte, Jira, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[finance](./finance)** | Prep journal entries, reconcile accounts, generate financial statements, analyze variances, manage close, and support audits. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Slack, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[data](./data)** | Query, visualize, and interpret datasets — write SQL, run statistical analysis, build dashboards, and validate your work before sharing. | Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, Hex, Amplitude, Jira |\n| **[enterprise-search](./enterprise-search)** | Find anything across email, chat, docs, and wikis — one query across all your company's tools. | Slack, Notion, Guru, Jira, Asana, Microsoft 365 |\n| **[bio-research](./bio-research)** | Connect to preclinical research tools and databases (literature search, genomics analysis, target prioritization) to accelerate early-stage life sciences R&D. | PubMed, BioRender, bioRxiv, ClinicalTrials.gov, ChEMBL, Synapse, Wiley, Owkin, Open Targets, Benchling |\n| **[cowork-plugin-management](./cowork-plugin-management)** | Create new plugins or customize existing ones for your organization's specific tools and workflows. | — |\n\nInstall these directly from Cowork, browse the full collection here on GitHub, or build your own.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Cowork\n\nInstall plugins from [claude.com/plugins](https://claude.com/plugins/).\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\n# Add the marketplace first\nclaude plugin marketplace add anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins\n\n# Then install a specific plugin\nclaude plugin install sales@knowledge-work-plugins\n```\n\nOnce installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session (e.g., `/sales:call-prep`, `/data:write-query`).\n\n## How Plugins Work\n\nEvery plugin follows the same structure:\n\n```\nplugin-name/\n├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest\n├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections\n├── commands/                    # Slash commands you invoke explicitly\n└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Claude draws on automatically\n```\n\n- **Skills** encode the domain expertise, best practices, and step-by-step workflows Claude needs to give you useful help. Claude draws on them automatically when relevant.\n- **Commands** are explicit actions you trigger (e.g., `/finance:reconciliation`, `/product-management:write-spec`).\n- **Connectors** wire Claude to the external tools your role depends on — CRMs, project trackers, data warehouses, design tools, and more — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).\n\nEvery component is file-based — markdown and ",

      "readme": "# /last30days v2.1\n\n**The AI world reinvents itself every month. This skill keeps you current.** /last30days researches your topic across Reddit, X, YouTube, and the web from the last 30 days, finds what the community is actually upvoting, sharing, and saying on camera, and writes you a prompt that works today, not six months ago. Whether it's Seedance 2.0 access, Suno music prompts, or the latest Nano Banana Pro techniques, you'll prompt like someone who's been paying attention.\n\n**New in V2.1  - three headline features:**\n\n1. **Open-class skill with watchlists.** Add any topic to a watchlist  - your competitors, specific people, emerging technologies  - and /last30days re-researches it on demand or via cron. Designed for always-on environments like [Open Claw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) where a bot can run research on a schedule and accumulate findings over time.\n2. **YouTube transcripts as a 4th source.** When yt-dlp is installed, /last30days automatically searches YouTube, grabs view counts, and extracts auto-generated transcripts from the top videos. A 20-minute review contains 10x the signal of a single post - now the skill reads it. Inspired by [@steipete](https://x.com/steipete)'s yt-dlp + [summarize](https://github.com/steipete/summarize) toolchain.\n3. **Works in OpenAI Codex CLI.** Same skill, same engine. Install to `~/.agents/skills/last30days` and invoke with `$last30days`. Claude Code and Codex users get the same research.\n\n**New in V2:** Dramatically better search results. Smarter query construction finds posts that V1 missed entirely, and a new two-phase search automatically discovers key @handles and subreddits from initial results, then drills deeper. Free X search (no xAI key needed), `--days=N` for flexible lookback, and automatic model fallback. [Full changelog below.](#whats-new-in-v2)\n\n**The tradeoff:** V2 finds way more content but takes longer - typically 2-8 minutes depending on how niche your topic is. The old V1 was faster but regularly missed results (like returning 0 X posts on trending topics). We think the depth is worth the wait, but if you'd use a faster \"quick mode\" that trades some depth for speed, let us know: [@mvanhorn](https://x.com/mvanhorn) / [@slashlast30days](https://x.com/slashlast30days).\n\n**Best for prompt research**: discover what prompting techniques actually work for any tool (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Claude, Figma AI, etc.) by learning from real community discussions and best practices.\n\n**But also great for anything trending**: music, culture, news, product recommendations, viral trends, or any question where \"what are people saying right now?\" matters.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/last30days\n\n# Add your API keys\nmkdir -p ~/.config/last30days\ncat > ~/.config/last30days/.env << 'EOF'\nOPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...\nXAI_API_KEY=xai-...       # optional  - cookie auth is default for X search\nEOF\nchmod 600 ~/.config/last30days/.env\n```\n\n### X Search Authentication\n\nX search reads your existing browser cookies  - no API keys or login commands needed.\n\n**Safari (recommended on Mac):** Just be logged into x.com. No setup needed.\n\n**Chrome:** Works, but macOS will prompt you to allow Keychain access the first time. Click \"Allow\" (or \"Always Allow\" to stop future prompts).\n\n**Firefox:** Just be logged into x.com. No setup needed.\n\n**Manual fallback:** If cookie auto-detection doesn't work, set these env vars (grab them from your browser's dev tools → Application → Cookies → x.com):\n```bash\nexport AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token\nexport CT0=your_ct0_token\n```\n\n**Verify it's working:**\n```bash\nnode ~/.claude/skills/last30days/scripts/lib/vendor/bird-search/bird-search.mjs --whoami\n```\n\n**Requirements:** Node.js 22+ (for the vendored Twitter GraphQL client).\n\n### Codex CLI\n\nThis skill also works in OpenAI Codex CLI. Install to the Codex skills directory instead:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill.git ~/.agents/skills/last30days\n```\n\nSame SKILL.md, same Python engine, same scripts. The `agents/openai.yaml` provides Codex-specific discovery metadata. Invoke with `$last30days` or through the `/skills` menu.\n\n### Open Variant (Watchlist + Briefings)  - For Always-On Bots\n\n**Designed for [Open Claw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) and similar always-on AI environments.** Add your competitors, specific people, or any topic to a watchlist. When paired with a cron job or always-on bot, /last30days re-researches them on a schedule and accumulates findings in a local SQLite database. Ask for a briefing anytime.\n\n**Important:** The watchlist stores schedules as metadata, but nothing triggers runs automatically. You need an external scheduler (cron, launchd, or an always-on bot like Open Claw) to call `watchlist.py run-all` on a timer. In plain Claude Code, you can run `watch run-one` and `watch run-all` manually, but there's no background scheduling.\n\n```bash\n# Ena",

Write once, apply forever |\n| **Auto-updated Spec Library** | Best practices live in auto-updated spec files. The more you use it, the better it gets |\n| **Parallel Sessions** | Run multiple agents in tandem - each in its own worktree |\n| **Team Sync** | Share specs across your team. One person's best practice benefits everyone |\n| **Session Persistence** | Work traces persist in your repo. AI remembers project context across sessions |\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# 1. Install globally\nnpm install -g @mindfoldhq/trellis@latest\n\n# 2. Initialize in your project directory\ntrellis init -u your-name\n\n# Or include iFlow CLI support\ntrellis init --iflow -u your-name\n\n# Or include Codex skills support\ntrellis init --codex -u your-name\n\n# 3. Start Claude Code and begin working\n```\n\n> `your-name` becomes your identifier and creates a personal workspace at `.trellis/workspace/your-name/`\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/info.png\" alt=\"Trellis Initialization Example\" />\n</p>\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### Educating Your AI\n\nWrite your specs in Markdown. Trellis injects them into every AI session — no more repeating yourself.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase1.png\" alt=\"Teaching AI - Teach Once, Apply Forever\" />\n</p>\n\nDefine your component guidelines, file structure rules, and patterns once. AI automatically applies them when creating new code — using TypeScript with Props interface, following PascalCase naming, building functional components with hooks.\n\n### Ship in Parallel\n\nSpawn multiple Claude sessions in isolated worktrees with `/trellis:parallel`. Work on several features at once, merge when ready.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase2.png\" alt=\"Parallel Work - Multiple features developing simultaneously\" />\n</p>\n\nWhile coding, each worker runs in its own worktree (physically isolated directory), no blocking, no interference. Review and merge completed features while others are still in progress.\n\n### Custom Workflows\n\nDefine custom skills & commands that prepare Claude for specific tasks and contexts.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"assets/usecase3.png\" alt=\"Workflows - Custom commands for instant context loading\" />\n</p>\n\nCreate commands like `/trellis:before-frontend-dev` that load component guidelines, check recent changes, pull in test patterns, and review shared hooks—all with a single slash.\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\n.trellis/\n├── workflow.md              # Workflow guide (auto-injected on start)\n├── worktree.yaml            # Multi-agent config (for /trellis:parallel)\n├── spec/                    # Spec library\n│   ├── frontend/            #   Frontend specs\n│   ├── backend/             #   Backend specs\n│   └── guides/              #   Decision & analysis frameworks\n├── workspace/{name}/        # Personal journal\n├── tasks/                   # Task management (progress tracking & more)\n└── scripts/                 # Utilities\n\n.claude/\n├── settings.json            # Hook configuration\n├── agents/                  # Agent definitions\n│   ├── dispatch.md          #   Dispatch Agent (pure routing, doesn't read specs)\n│   ├── implement.md         #   Implement Agent\n│   ├── check.md             #   Check Agent\n│   └── research.md          #   Research Agent\n├── commands/                # Slash commands\n└── hooks/                   # Hook scripts\n ",

It introduces Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) loss and stable full-task reinforcement learning to improve training efficiency, recognition accuracy, and generalization. The model integrates the CogViT visual encoder pre-trained on large-scale image–text data, a lightweight cross-modal connector with efficient token downsampling, and a GLM-0.5B language decoder. Combined with a two-stage pipeline of layout analysis and parallel recognition based on PP-DocLayout-V3, GLM-OCR delivers robust and high-quality OCR performance across diverse document layouts.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves a score of 94.62 on OmniDocBench V1.5, ranking #1 overall, and delivers state-of-the-art results across major document understanding benchmarks, including formula recognition, table recognition, and information extraction.\n\n- **Optimized for Real-World Scenarios**: Designed and optimized for practical business use cases, maintaining robust performance on complex tables, code-heavy documents, seals, and other challenging real-world layouts.\n\n- **Efficient Inference**: With only 0.9B parameters, GLM-OCR supports deployment via vLLM, SGLang, and Ollama, significantly reducing inference latency and compute cost, making it ideal for high-concurrency services and edge deployments.\n\n- **Easy to Use**: Fully open-sourced and equipped with a comprehensive [SDK](https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-OCR) and inference toolchain, offering simple installation, one-line invocation, and smooth integration into existing production pipelines.\n\n### News & Updates\n\n- **[Coming Soon]** GLM-OCR Technical Report\n- **[2026.2.12]** Fine-tuning tutorial based on LLaMA-Factory is now available. See: [GLM-OCR Fine-tuning Guide](examples/finetune/README.md)\n\n### Download Model\n\n| Model   | Download Links                                                                                                              | Precision |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |\n| GLM-OCR | [🤗 Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-OCR)<br> [🤖 ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/ZhipuAI/GLM-OCR) | BF16      |\n\n## GLM-OCR SDK\n\nWe provide an SDK for using GLM-OCR more efficiently and conveniently.\n\n### Install SDK\n\n> [UV Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n```bash\n# Install from source\ngit clone https://github.com/zai-org/glm-ocr.git\ncd glm-ocr\nuv venv --python 3.12 --seed && source .venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install -e .\n```\n\n### Model Deployment\n\nTwo ways to use GLM-OCR:\n\n#### Option 1: Zhipu MaaS API (Recommended for Quick Start)\n\nUse the hosted cloud API – no GPU needed. The cloud service runs the complete GLM-OCR pipeline internally, so the SDK simply forwards your request and returns the result.\n\n1. Get an API key from https://open.bigmodel.cn\n2. Configure `config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\npipeline:\n  maas:\n    enabled: true # Enable MaaS mode\n    api_key: your-api-key # Required\n```\n\nThat's it! When `maas.enabled=true`, the SDK acts as a thin wrapper that:\n\n- Forwards your documents to the Zhipu cloud API\n- Returns the results directly (Markdown + JSON layout details)\n- No local processing, no GPU required\n\nInput note (MaaS): the upstream API accepts `file` as a URL or a `data:<mime>;base64,...` data URI.\nIf you have raw base64 without the `data:` prefix, wrap it as a data URI (recommended). The SDK will\nauto-wrap local file paths / bytes / raw base64 into a data URI when calling MaaS.\n\nAPI documentation: https://docs.bigmodel.cn/cn/guide/models/vlm/glm-ocr\n\n#### Option 2: Self-host with vLLM / SGLang\n\nDeploy the GLM-OCR model locally for full control. The SDK provides the complete pipeline: layout detection, parallel region OCR, and result formatting.\n\n##### Using vLLM\n\nInstall vLLM:\n\n```bash\nuv pip install -U vllm --torch-backend=auto --extra-index-url https://wheels.vllm.ai/nightly\n# Or use Docker\ndocker pull vllm/vllm-openai:nightly\n```\n\nLaunch the service:\n\n```bash\n# In docker container, uv may not be need for transformers install\nuv pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n\n# Run with MTP for better performance\nvllm serve zai-org/GLM-OCR --allowed-local-media-path / --port 8080 --speculative-config '{\"method\": \"mtp\", \"num_speculative_tokens\": 1}' --served-model-name glm-ocr\n```\n\n##### Using SGLang\n\nIn",

Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and login\n2. Add OS → Local → `http://localhost:8000`\n3. Click \"Connect\"\n\n**Try it** (sample F1 dataset):\n\n- Who won the most F1 World Championships?\n- How many races has Lewis Hamilton won?\n- Compare Ferrari vs Mercedes points 2015-2020\n\n## Why Text-to-SQL Breaks in Practice\n\nOur goal is simple: ask a question in english, get a correct, meaningful answer. But raw LLMs writing SQL hit a wall fast:\n\n- **Schemas lack meaning.**\n- **Types are misleading.**\n- **Tribal knowledge is missing.**\n- **No way to learn from mistakes.**\n- **Results generally lack interpretation.**\n\nThe root cause is missing context and missing memory.\n\nDash solves this with **6 layers of grounded context**, a **self-learning loop** that improves with every query, and a focus on **understanding your question** to deliver insights you can act on.\n\n## The Six Layers of Context\n\n| Layer | Purpose | Source |\n|------|--------|--------|\n| **Table Usage** | Schema, columns, relationships | `knowledge/tables/*.json` |\n| **Human Annotations** | Metrics, definitions, and business rules | `knowledge/business/*.json` |\n| **Query Patterns** | SQL that is known to work | `knowledge/queries/*.sql` |\n| **Institutional Knowledge** | Docs, wikis, external references | MCP (optional) |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and discovered fixes | Agno `Learning Machine` |\n| **Runtime Context** | Live schema changes | `introspect_schema` tool |\n\nThe agent retrieves relevant context at query time via hybrid search, then generates SQL grounded in patterns that already work.\n\n## The Self-Learning Loop\n\nDash improves without retraining or fine-tuning. We call this gpu-poor continuous learning.\n\nIt learns through two complementary systems:\n\n| System | Stores | How It Evolves |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **Knowledge** | Validated queries and business context | Curated by you + dash |\n| **Learnings** | Error patterns and fixes | Managed by `Learning Machine` automatically |\n\n```\nUser Question\n     ↓\nRetrieve Knowledge + Learnings\n     ↓\nReason about intent\n     ↓\nGenerate grounded SQL\n     ↓\nExecute and interpret\n     ↓\n ┌────┴────┐\n ↓         ↓\nSuccess    Error\n ↓         ↓\n ↓         Diagnose → Fix → Save Learning\n ↓                           (never repeated)\n ↓\nReturn insight\n ↓\nOptionally save as Knowledge\n```\n\n**Knowledge** is curated—validated queries and business context you want the agent to build on.\n\n**Learnings** is discovered—patterns the agent finds through trial and error. When a query fails because `position` is TEXT not INTEGER, the agent saves that gotcha. Next time, it knows.\n\n## Insights, Not Just Rows\n\nDash reasons about what makes an answer useful, not just technically correct.\n\n**Question:**\nWho won the most races in 2019?\n\n| Typical SQL Agent | Dash |\n|------------------|------|\n| `Hamilton: 11` | Lewis Hamilton dominated 2019 with **11 wins out of 21 races**, more than double Bottas’s 4 wins. This performance secured his sixth world championship. |\n\n## Deploy to Railway\n\n```sh\nrailway login\n\n./scripts/railway_up.sh\n```\n\n### Production Operations\n\n**Load data and knowledge:**\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_data\nrailway run python -m dash.scripts.load_knowledge\n```\n\n**View logs:**\n\n```sh\nrailway logs --service dash\n```\n\n**Run commands in production:**\n\n```sh\nrailway run python -m dash  # CLI mode\n```\n\n**Redeploy after changes:**\n\n```sh\nrailway up --service dash -d\n```\n\n**Open dashboard:**\n```sh\nrailway open\n```\n\n## Adding Knowledge\n\nDash works best when it understands how your organization talks about data.\n\n```\nknowledge/\n├── tables/      # Table meaning and caveats\n├── queries/     # Proven SQL patterns\n└── business/    # Metrics and language\n```\n\n### Table Metadata\n\n```\n{\n  \"table_name\": \"orders\",\n  \"table_description\": \"Customer orders with denormalized line items\",\n  \"use_cases\": [\"Revenue reporting\", \"Customer analytics\"],\n  \"data_quality_notes\": [\n    \"created_at is UTC\",\n    \"status values: pending, completed, refunded\",\n    \"amount stored in cents\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Query Patterns\n\n```\n-- <query name>monthly_revenue</query name>\n-- <query description>\n-- Monthly revenue calculation.\n-- Converts cents to dollars.\n-- Excludes refunded orders.\n-- </query description>",

Both leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding capability of their foundation model, Qwen3-Omni. Experiments show that the 1.7B version achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary commercial APIs. Here are the main features:\n\n* **All-in-one**: Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B support language identification and speech recognition for 30 languages and 22 Chinese dialects, so as to English accents from multiple countries and regions.\n\n* **Excellent and Fast**: The Qwen3-ASR family ASR models maintains high-quality and robust recognition under complex acoustic environments and challenging text patterns. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B achieves strong performance on both open-sourced and internal benchmarks. While the 0.6B version achieves accuracy-efficient trade-off, it reaches 2000 times throughput at a concurrency of 128. They both achieve streaming / offline unified inference with single model and support transcribe long audio.\n\n* **Novel and strong forced alignment Solution**: We introduce Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B, which supports timestamp prediction for arbitrary units within up to 5 minutes of speech in 11 languages. Evaluations show its timestamp accuracy surpasses E2E based forced-alignment models.\n\n* **Comprehensive inference toolkit**: In addition to open-sourcing the architectures and weights of the Qwen3-ASR series, we also release a powerful, full-featured inference framework that supports vLLM-based batch inference, asynchronous serving, streaming inference, timestamp prediction, and more.\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen3-ASR-Repo/overview.jpg\" width=\"100%\"/>\n<p>\n\n\n### Released Models Description and Download\n\nBelow is an introduction and download information for the Qwen3-ASR models.

Keep your facts.\"*\n\n**Cut your AI agent's token spend in half.** One command compresses your entire workspace — memory files, session transcripts, sub-agent context — using 5 layered compression techniques. Deterministic. Mostly lossless. No LLM required.\n\n## Features\n- **5 compression layers** working in sequence for maximum savings\n- **Zero LLM cost** — all compression is rule-based and deterministic\n- **Lossless roundtrip** for dictionary, RLE, and rule-based compression\n- **~97% savings** on session transcripts via observation extraction\n- **Tiered summaries** (L0/L1/L2) for progressive context loading\n- **CJK-aware** — full Chinese/Japanese/Korean support\n- **One command** (`full`) runs everything in optimal order\n\n## 5 Compression Layers\n| 1 | Rule engine | Dedup lines, strip markdown filler, merge sections | 4-8% | |\n| 2 | Dictionary encoding | Auto-learned codebook, `$XX` substitution | 4-5% | |\n| 3 | Observation compression | Session JSONL → structured summaries | ~97% | * |\n| 4 | RLE patterns | Path shorthand (`$WS`), IP prefix, enum compaction | 1-2% | |\n| 5 | Compressed Context Protocol | ultra/medium/light abbreviation | 20-60% | * |\n\n\\*Lossy techniques preserve all facts and decisions; only verbose formatting is removed.\n\n## Quick Start\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/aeromomo/claw-compactor.git\ncd claw-compactor\n\n# See how much you'd save (non-destructive)\npython3 scripts/mem_compress.py /path/to/workspace benchmark\n\n# Compress everything\npython3 scripts/mem_compress.py /path/to/workspace full\n```\n\n**Requirements:** Python 3.9+.

Together: 50% compression + 90% cache discount = **95% effective cost reduction**.\n\n## Heartbeat Automation\nRun weekly or on heartbeat:\n\n```markdown\n\n#",

Combines **pattern-based detection** (YAML + YARA), **LLM-as-a-judge**, and **behavioral dataflow analysis** to maximize detection coverage of probable threats while minimizing false positives.\n\n> **Important:** This scanner provides best-effort detection, not comprehensive or complete coverage. A scan that returns no findings does not guarantee that a skill is free of all threats. See [Scope and Limitations](#scope-and-limitations) below.\n\nSupports [OpenAI Codex Skills](https://openai.github.io/codex/) and [Cursor Agent Skills](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) formats following the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io).\n\n---\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Multi-Engine Detection** - Static analysis, behavioral dataflow, LLM semantic analysis, and cloud-based scanning for layered, best-effort coverage\n- **False Positive Filtering** - Meta-analyzer significantly reduces noise while preserving detection capability\n- **CI/CD Ready** - SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning, exit codes for build failures\n- **Extensible** - Plugin architecture for custom analyzers\n\n**[Join the Cisco AI Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nKWtDcXxtx)** to discuss, share feedback, or connect with the team.\n\n---\n\n## Scope and Limitations\n\nSkill Scanner is a detection tool. It identifies known and probable risk patterns, but it does not certify security.\n\n**Key limitations:**\n\n- **No findings ≠ no risk.** A scan that returns \"No findings\" indicates that no known threat patterns were detected. It does not guarantee that a skill is secure, benign, or free of vulnerabilities.\n- **Coverage is inherently incomplete.** The scanner combines signature-based detection, LLM-based semantic analysis, behavioral dataflow analysis, optional cloud services, and configurable rule packs. While this approach improve coverage, no automated tool can detect every technique, especially novel or zero-day attacks.\n- **False positives and false negatives can occur.** Consensus modes and meta-analysis reduce noise, but no configuration eliminates all incorrect classifications. Tune the [scan policy](docs/scan-policy.md) to your risk tolerance.\n- **Human review remains essential.** Automated scanning is one component of a defense-in-depth strategy. High-risk or production deployments should pair scanner results with manual code review and/or  threat modeling.\n\n---\n\n## Documentation\n\n| Guide | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Quick Start](docs/quickstart.md) | Get started in 5 minutes |\n| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | System design and components |\n| [Threat Taxonomy](docs/threat-taxonomy.md) | Complete AITech threat taxonomy with examples |\n| [LLM Analyzer](docs/llm-analyzer.md) | LLM configuration and usage |\n| [Meta-Analyzer](docs/meta-analyzer.md) | False positive filtering and prioritization |\n| [Behavioral Analyzer](docs/behavioral-analyzer.md) | Dataflow analysis details |\n| [Scan Policy](docs/scan-policy.md) | Custom policies, presets, and tuning guide |\n| [Policy Quick Reference](docs/POLICY.md) | Compact reference for policy sections and knobs |\n| [Rule Authoring](docs/AUTHORING.md) | How to add signature, YARA, and Python rules |\n| [API Reference](docs/api-server.md) | REST API documentation |\n| [Development Guide](docs/developing.md) | Contributing and development setup |\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\n**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip\n\n```bash\n# Using uv (recommended)\nuv pip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner\n\n# Using pip\npip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Cloud Provider Extras</strong></summary>\n\n```bash\n# AWS Bedrock support\npip install cisco-ai-skill-scanner[bedrock]\n\n# Google Vertex AI support\npip install cisco-ai-s",

      "readme": "# OpenPlanter\n\nA recursive-language-model investigation agent with a terminal UI. OpenPlanter ingests heterogeneous datasets — corporate registries, campaign finance records, lobbying disclosures, government contracts, and more — resolves entities across them, and surfaces non-obvious connections through evidence-backed analysis. It operates autonomously with file I/O, shell execution, web search, and recursive sub-agent delegation.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n```bash\n# Install\npip install -e .\n\n# Configure API keys (interactive prompt)\nopenplanter-agent --configure-keys\n\n# Launch the TUI\nopenplanter-agent --workspace /path/to/your/project\n```\n\nOr run a single task headlessly:\n\n```bash\nopenplanter-agent --task \"Cross-reference vendor payments against lobbying disclosures and flag overlaps\" --workspace ./data\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```bash\n# Add your API keys to .env, then:\ndocker compose up\n```\n\nThe container mounts `./workspace` as the agent's working directory.\n\n## Supported Providers\n\n| Provider | Default Model | Env Var |\n|----------|---------------|---------|\n| OpenAI | `gpt-5.2` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |\n| Anthropic | `claude-opus-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |\n| OpenRouter | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |\n| Cerebras | `qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` |\n| Ollama | `llama3.2` | (none — local) |\n\n### Local Models (Ollama)\n\n[Ollama](https://ollama.com) runs models locally with no API key. Install Ollama, pull a model (`ollama pull llama3.2`), then:\n\n```bash\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama --model mistral\nopenplanter-agent --provider ollama --list-models\n```\n\nThe base URL defaults to `http://localhost:11434/v1` and can be overridden with `OPENPLANTER_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` or `--base-url`. The first request may be slow while Ollama loads the model into memory; a 120-second first-byte timeout is used automatically.\n\nAdditional service keys: `EXA_API_KEY` (web search), `VOYAGE_API_KEY` (embeddings).\n\nAll keys can also be set with an `OPENPLANTER_` prefix (e.g. `OPENPLANTER_OPENAI_API_KEY`), via `.env` files in the workspace, or via CLI flags.\n\n## Agent Tools\n\nThe agent has access to 19 tools, organized around its investigation workflow:\n\n**Dataset ingestion & workspace** — `list_files`, `search_files`, `repo_map`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `hashline_edit`, `apply_patch` — load, inspect, and transform source datasets; write structured findings.\n\n**Shell execution** — `run_shell`, `run_shell_bg`, `check_shell_bg`, `kill_shell_bg` — run analysis scripts, data pipelines, and validation checks.\n\n**Web** — `web_search` (Exa), `fetch_url` — pull public records, verify entities, and retrieve supplementary data.\n\n**Planning & delegation** — `think`, `subtask`, `execute`, `list_artifacts`, `read_artifact` — decompose investigations into focused sub-tasks, each with acceptance criteria and independent verification.\n\nIn **recursive mode** (the default), the agent spawns sub-agents via `subtask` and `execute` to parallelize entity resolution, cross-dataset linking, and evidence-chain construction across large investigations.\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```\nopenplanter-agent [options]\n```\n\n### Workspace & Session\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--workspace DIR` | Workspace root (default: `.`) |\n| `--session-id ID` | Use a specific session ID |\n| `--resume` | Resume the latest (or specified) session |\n| `--list-sessions` | List saved sessions and exit |\n\n### Model Selection\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--provider NAME` | `auto`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `openrouter`, `cerebras`, `ollama` |\n| `--model NAME` | Model name or `newest` to auto-select |\n| `--reasoning-effort LEVEL` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `none` |\n| `--list-models` | Fetch available models from the provider API |\n\n### Execution\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--task OBJECTIVE` | Run a single task and exit (headless) |\n| `--recursive` | Enable recursive sub-agent delegation |\n| `--acceptance-criteria` | Judge subtask results with a lightweight model |\n| `--max-depth N` | Maximum recursion depth (default: 4) |\n| `--max-steps N` | Maximum steps per call (default: 100) |\n| `--timeout N` | Shell command timeout in seconds (default: 45) |\n\n### UI\n\n| Flag | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `--no-tui` | Plain REPL (no colors or spinner) |\n| `--headless` | Non-interactive mode (for CI) |\n| `--demo` | Censor entity names and workspace paths in output |\n\n### Persistent Defaults\n\nUse `--default-model`, `--default-reasoning-effort`, or per-provider variants like `--default-model-openai` to save workspace defaults to `.openplanter/settings.json`. View them with `--show-settings`.\n\n## TUI Commands\n\nInside the interactive REPL:\n\n| Command | Action |\n|---------|--------|\n| `/model` | Show current model and provider |\n| `/model NAME` | Switch model (aliases: `opus`, `sonnet`, `gpt5`, etc.) |\n| `/model NAME --save` | Switch and persist as default |\n| `/mod",
